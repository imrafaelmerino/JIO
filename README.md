## <a name="cwa"><a/> Code wins arguments

I think the age-old "Hello world" example has outlived its usefulness. While it once served as a foundational teaching
tool, its simplicity no longer suffices in today's world. In the current landscape, where real-world scenarios are
markedly more intricate, I present a "Hello world" example that truly mirrors the complexity of modern development.

### Signup Service specification

Let's jump into the implementation of a signup service with the following requirements:

1. The signup service takes a JSON input containing at least two fields: email and address, both expected as strings.
   The service's first step is to validate and standardize the address using the Google Geocode API. The results
   obtained from Google are then presented to the frontend for user selection or rejection.
2. In addition to address validation, the service stores the client's information in a MongoDB database. The MongoDB
   identifier returned becomes the client identifier, which must be sent back to the frontend. If the client is
   successfully saved in the database and the user doesn't exist in an LDAP system, two additional actions occur:
    - The user is sent to the LDAP service.
    - If the previous operation succeeds, an activation email is sent to the user.
3. The signup service also provides information about the total number of existing clients in the MongoDB database. This
   information can be utilized by the frontend to display a welcoming message to the user, such as "You're the user
   number 3000!" If an error occurs the service returns -1, and the frontend will not display the message.
4. Crucially, the signup service is designed to perform all these operations in parallel. This includes the request to
   Google for address validation and the MongoDB operations, which encompass both data persistence and counting.
5. The signup service also returns a timestamp indicating the instant the service started composing the response. This
   timestamp can be used by the frontend to show the user the exact date and time they joined.

### Response Structure

The response from the signup service follows this structure:

```code
{
  "number_users": integer,
  "id": string,
  "timestamp": instant,
  "addresses": array
}
```

### Signup Service implementation

The `SignupService` orchestrates all the operations with elegance and efficiency. This service is constructed with a set
of [lambdas](#Lambdas), where a lambda is essentially a function that takes an input and produces an output. Unlike
traditional functions, lambdas don't throw exceptions; instead, they gracefully return exceptions as regular values.

```java
import jio.*;
import jio.time.Clock;
import jsonvalues.*;

import java.time.Instant;

import static java.util.Objects.requireNonNull;

public class SignupService implements Lambda<JsObj, JsObj> {

    Lambda<JsObj, Void> persistLDAP;
    Lambda<String, JsArray> normalizeAddresses;
    Supplier<IO<Integer>> countUsers;
    Lambda<JsObj, String> persistMongo;
    Lambda<JsObj, Void> sendEmail;
    Lambda<String, Boolean> existsInLDAP;
    Clock clock;

    //constructor

    @Override
    public IO<JsObj> apply(JsObj user) {

        String email = user.getStr("email");
        String address = user.getStr("address");
        String context = "signup";

        Lambda<String, String> LDAPFlow =
                id -> IfElseExp.<String>predicate(existsInLDAP.apply(email))
                               .consequence(() -> IO.succeed(id))
                               .alternative(() -> PairExp.seq(persistLDAP.apply(user),
                                                              sendEmail.apply(user)
                                                             )
                                                         .debugEach(context)
                                                         .map(n -> id)
                                           )
                               .debugEach(context);

        return JsObjExp.par("number_users", countUsers.get()
                                                      .recover(exc -> -1)
                                                      .map(JsInt::of),

                            "id", persistMongo.then(LDAPFlow)
                                              .apply(user)
                                              .map(JsStr::of),

                            "addresses", normalizeAddresses.apply(address),

                            "timestamp", IO.lazy(clock)
                                           .map(ms -> JsInstant.of(Instant.ofEpochMilli(ms)))
                           )
                       .debugEach(context);
    }
}

```

Noteworthy points:

- **Clocks**: In modern programming, managing time is critical, and using `Instant.now()` directly throughout your code
  introduces side effects. I advocate using clocks, represented by the `clock` instance in our `SignupService`. They
  provide better control and makes your code more predictable.

- **JsObjExp**: The `JsObjExp` expression is highly expressive. It allows us to define the
  structure of the resulting JSON object in a clear and declarative manner. In our code, we use it to construct a JSON
  object with multiple key-value pairs, each representing a specific piece of information
  (`"number_users"`, `"id"`, `"addresses"`, `"timestamp"`, etc.). This approach simplifies the creation of complex JSON
  structures and enhances code readability.

- Error handling is handled gracefully with the `recover` functions, providing alternative values (e.g., -1
  for `countUsers`) in case of errors.

- **IfElseExp**: The `IfElseExp` expression is a clear and concise way to handle conditional logic. It enables us to
  specify the consequence and alternative branches based on a predicate (`existsInLDAP.apply(email)` in this case). This
  expressiveness makes it evident that if the user exists in LDAP, we succeed with an ID, otherwise, we perform a
  sequence of operations using `PairExp`. It enhances the readability of the code, making it easy to understand the
  branching logic.

- **PairExp**: The `PairExp` expression streamlines the execution of two effects, either sequentially or in
  parallel, and then combines their results into a pair. In this scenario, we utilize `PairExp.seq` to execute
  the `persistLDAP` and `sendEmail` operations sequentially. However, it's essential to emphasize that in this
  particular example, our primary concern is the successful completion of both operations. Therefore, in the absence of
  any failures, the result will be a pair containing two `null` values: (null, null), as both operations return `Void`.

- **debugEach**: Debugging plays a pivotal role in software development, and real-world applications often handle a
  multitude of messages from various users and requests. When issues arise, identifying which log events are pertinent
  to the problem can be challenging, particularly in high-traffic scenarios. JIO streamlines the debugging process and
  enhances contextual logging through its `debug` and `debugEach` methods.

- **JFR (Java Flight Recorder)**: JIO leverages JFR for logging and debugging purposes. This choice offers several
  advantages. First, it's Java-native, which means it seamlessly integrates with the Java ecosystem, ensuring
  compatibility and performance. Second, it avoids the complexities and potential conflicts associated with using
  external logging libraries, of which there are many in the Java landscape. By relying on JFR, we maintain a
  lightweight and efficient approach to logging that is both reliable and highly effective.

- Last but not least, the backbone of JIO is the `IO` class that we'll explore in detail in the next section.

### Testing the Signup Service with JIO

JIO offers an elegant and efficient approach to testing. It eliminates the need for external libraries like Mockito,
making your testing experience smoother and more expressive. Since Lambdas are just functions, you can implement them
in your test class, directly. This approach enables you to tailor the behavior of each lambda to your specific test
scenario, making your tests highly adaptable and expressive:

```code


public class SignupTests {

    @RegisterExtension
    static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

    @Test
    public void test() {

        Lambda<JsObj, Void> persistLDAP = _ -> IO.NULL();
        
        Lambda<String, JsArray> normalizeAddresses =
                _ -> IO.succeed(JsArray.of("address1", "address2"));
        
        Supplier<IO<Integer>> countUsers = () -> IO.succeed(3);
        
        Lambda<JsObj, String> persistMongo = _ -> IO.succeed("id");
        
        Lambda<JsObj, Void> sendEmail = _ -> IO.NULL();
        
        Lambda<String, Boolean> existsInLDAP = _ -> IO.FALSE;

        JsObj user = JsObj.of("email", JsStr.of("imrafaelmerino@gmail.com"),
                              "address", JsStr.of("Elm's Street")
                             );

        JsObj resp = new SignupService(persistLDAP,
                                       normalizeAddresses,
                                       countUsers,
                                       persistMongo,
                                       sendEmail,
                                       existsInLDAP,
                                       Clock.realTime
                                       )
                                      .apply(user)
                                      .result();
        //Junit assertions
        Assertions.assertTrue(resp.containsKey("number_users"));
        
    }

}

```

### Debugging with the Debugger Extension

When it comes to debugging your code during testing, having access to detailed information is invaluable. JIO's Debugger
extension simplifies this process by creating an event stream for a specified duration and printing all the events sent
to the Java Flight Recorder (JFR) system during that period.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Debugger Extension Registration**: In your test class, you register the Debugger JUnit extension using
   the `@RegisterExtension` annotation. You specify the duration for which the debugger captures events.

2. **Using `debug` and `debugEach`**: Within your code, you utilize the `debug` and `debugEach` methods provided by JIO.
   These methods allow you to send events to the JFR system after a value or expression is being evaluated.

3. **Event Printing**: During the execution of the test for the specified duration, the Debugger extension prints out
   all the events that were sent to the JFR system. These events include information about the expressions being
   evaluated, their results, execution durations, contextual data, and more.

4. **Stream Ordering**: Importantly, the event stream is ordered. Events are printed in the order in which they
   occurred, providing a clear chronological view of your code's execution.

5. **Pinpointing Bugs and Issues**: With the event stream and detailed logs in hand, you can easily pinpoint any bugs,
   unexpected behavior, or performance bottlenecks.

In summary, the Debugger extension in JIO transforms the testing and debugging process into a streamlined and
informative experience with minimal effort from developers. It empowers developers to gain deep insights into their
code's behavior without relying on external logging libraries or complex setups.

And finally, find below all the events that are printed out during the execution of the previous JUnit test.

```

```

The events printed out are self-explanatory.

In summary, these traces are like breadcrumbs that guide you through your code, making testing and debugging more
efficient and effective. They enable you to pinpoint issues, optimize performance, and gain a deeper understanding of
how your code behaves during testing.

In the previous example, you may have observed that all evaluations were performed by the main thread. This is because
the IO effects returned by the lambdas were essentially constants, and no specific `Executor` was defined. Even if
an `Executor` were specified, there are cases where the CompletableFuture framework, heavily relied upon by JIO, may
choose not to switch contexts between threads if it deems it unnecessary.

However, you can introduce random delays and leverage virtual threads to create a more realistic example. To achieve
this, more complex stubs are used from the `jio-test` library through the `StubBuilder` class. These stubs allow you to
specify generators for their creation, ensuring different values are returned every time. Here's how you can utilize
them:

```code
@Test
public void test(){

    Gen<Duration> delayGen = IntGen.arbitrary(0, 200)
                                   .map(Duration::ofMillis);

    Supplier<IO<Integer>> countUsers =
            () -> StubBuilder.ofGen(IntGen.arbitrary(0, 100000))
                            .withDelays(delayGen)          
                            .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                            .build();

    Lambda<JsObj, String> persistMongo =
            _ -> StubBuilder.ofGen(StrGen.alphabetic(20, 20))
                            .withDelays(delayGen)
                            .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                            .build();

    Lambda<JsObj, Void> sendEmail =
            _ -> StubBuilder.ofGen(Gen.cons(null))
                            .withDelays(delayGen)
                            .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                            .build();

    Lambda<String, Boolean> existsInLDAP =
            _ -> StubBuilder.ofGen(BoolGen.arbitrary())
                            .withDelays(delayGen)
                            .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                            .build();
    
    Lambda<JsObj, Void> persistLDAP =
            _ -> StubBuilder.ofGen(Gen.cons(null))
                            .withDelays(delayGen)  
                            .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                            .build();

    Lambda<String, JsArray> normalizeAddresses =
            _ -> StubBuilder.ofGen(JsArrayGen.ofN(JsStrGen.alphabetic(), 3))
                            .withDelays(delayGen)  
                            .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                            .build();    
}
```

These `StubBuilder` instances are essentially builders that create IO stubs. They allow you to introduce
variability and randomness into your tests, making them more realistic and ensuring your code can handle different
scenarios effectively. I recommend you take a look at [jio-test](#jio-test) and [property-based-testing](#pbt).

Using that stubs the following events were printed out:

```

To enhance the resilience of our code, let's introduce some retry logic for the `countUsers` supplier. We want to allow
up
to three retries:

``` code                                
        // let's add up to three retries 
        countUsers.get()
                  .debug(EventBuilder.of("count_users", context)) 
                  .retry(RetryPolicies.limitRetries(3))
                  .recover(_ -> -1)                                                 
```

In this code:

- The `countUsers` supplier is executed, and for each execution, the `debug` method creates an event. The `EventBuilder`
  allows you to specify the name of the expression being evaluated ("count_users") and the context. This helps customize
  the events sent to the JFR system.

- The `retry` method is used to introduce retry logic. In case of failure, `countUser` will be retried up to three
  times.

- The `recover` method specifies what value to return in case of a failure.

And to test it, let's change the stub for the `countUser` lambda:

```code

//let's change the delay of every stub to 1 sec, for the sake of clarity
Gen<Duration> delayGen = Gen.cons(1).map(Duration::ofSeconds);
        
Lambda<Void, Integer> countUsers =
        nill -> StubBuilder.ofDelayedIOGen(Gens.seq(n -> n <= 4 ?
                                               IO.fail(new RuntimeException(n + "")) :
                                               IO.succeed(n)
                                               ),
                                      delayGen
                                      )
                       .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                       .get();

```

In this code:

- The `Gen.cons(1).map(Duration::ofSeconds)` defines a generator `delayGen` that provides a constant delay of 1 second.

- The `countUsers` lambda is defined to use the `StubBuilder` with a sequence generator (`Gens.seq`) that allows you to
  choose different values for each call. In this case the first four calls triggers a failure, which is treated as a
  value that can be returned.

This setup allows you to test and observe the retry logic in action:

```

Key points:

1. After the first failure and three retries, the value -1 from the `recover` function is returned

2. The `retry` method can accept a predicate, allowing you to specify which errors should trigger a retry. This
   fine-grained control is valuable for handling specific error scenarios.

3. Retry policies in JIO are composable, making it easy to build complex retry strategies. For example, you can create a
   policy like this:

   ```code
   RetryPolicies.constantDelay(Duration.ofMillis(50))
                .limitRetriesByCumulativeDelay(Duration.ofMillis(300))
   ```

   This policy specifies a constant delay of 50 milliseconds between retries and limits retries by a cumulative delay of
   300 milliseconds.

4. JIO excels at scalability. Even when dealing with complex logic, it maintains simplicity in the expressions you
   write, avoiding the complexities of callback hell or other frameworks.

5. JIO offers a high signal-to-noise ratio. It reduces verbosity, allowing you to express complex operations succinctly
   and clearly.

## <a name="Introduction"><a/> Introduction

Functional Programming is all about working with pure functions and values. That's all. **However, where FP especially
shines is dealing with effects**.

But, what is an effect?

First take a look at the following piece of code:

```code  
  
int a = sum(1,2) + 3;  
  
int b = sum(1,2) + 1;  
  
```  

As far as the function `sum` is **pure**, you can refactor the previous piece of code and call the function just once:

```code  
  
int c = sum(1,2);  
  
int a = c + 3;  
  
int b = c + 1;  
  
```  

Both programs are equivalents and wherever you see `sum(1,2)` you can replace it by `c` without changing the meaning of
the program at all.

An effect, on the other hand, is something you can't call more than once unless you intended to:

```code  
  
Instant a = Instant.now().plus(Period.ofDays(1));  
  
Instant b = Instant.now().plus(Period.ofDays(2));  
  
```  

Because _now()_ returns a different value each time it's called and therefore is not a pure function, `a` and `b` are
different instants. Doing the following refactoring would change completely the meaning of the program (and still your
favourite IDE suggests you to do it at times!):

```code  
  
Instant now = Instant.now();  
  
Instant a = now.plus(Period.ofDays(1));  
  
Instant b = now.plus(Period.ofDays(2));  
  
```  

Here's when laziness comes into play. Since Java 8, we have suppliers. They are indispensable to do FP in Java. The
following piece of code is equivalent to the previous where `a` and `b` are two different instants:

```code  
  
Supplier<Instant> now = () -> Instant.now();  
  
Instant a = now.get().plus(Period.ofDays(1));  
  
Instant b = now.get().plus(Period.ofDays(2));  
  
```  

This property that allows you to factor out expressions is called **referential transparency**, and it's fundamental to
create and compose expressions.

What can you expect from JIO:

- Simple and powerful API
- Errors are first class citizens
- Simple and powerful testing tools ([jio-test](#jio-test))
- Easy to extend and get benefit from all the above. Examples are [jio-http](#jio-http) and [jio-mongodb](#jio-mongodb).
  And you can create your owns integrations!
- I don't fall into the logging-library war. This is something that sucks in Java. I just use Java Flight Recording!
- Almost zero dependencies (just plain Java!)
- JIO doesn't transliterate any functional API from other languages. This way, any standard Java programmer will find
  JIO quite easy and familiar.

[![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.imrafaelmerino/jio-exp/1.0.0-RC3)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.imrafaelmerino/jio-exp/1.0.0-RC3/jar "jio-ex")


Let's model a funcional effect in Java!

```code  
  
import java.util.function.Supplier;  
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;  
  
public abstract class IO<O> implements Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
    @Override  
    public CompletableFuture<O> get();  
       
    public O result(){
        return get().join();
    }

}  
  
```  

Key Concepts:

- **`IO`  Definition**: The `IO` class is a fundamental component of JIO. It's an abstract class designed to represent
  functional effects or computations.

- **Lazy Computation**: `IO` is a lazy computation and is realized as a `Supplier`. In essence, it merely
  outlines a computation without immediate execution, awaiting the explicit invocation of methods like `get()`
  or `result()`. It's important to note that `result` operation is blocking, which isn't an issue when employing virtual
  threads. As you'll soon discover, integrating virtual threads with JIO is a straightforward process!

- **Asynchronous Effects**: `IO` leverages `CompletableFuture` to represent asynchronous effects. Asynchronous effects
  are essential for avoiding thread blocking, especially when dealing with operations that might introduce latency.

- **Handling Errors**: A critical aspect of JIO is that `CompletableFuture` can represent both successful and failed
  computations. This approach ensures that errors are treated as first-class citizens, avoiding the need to throw  
  exceptions whenever an error occurs.

---  

### <a name="Creating-effects"><a/> Creating effects

Now that we got the ball rolling, let's learn how to create IO effects.

**From a constant or a computed value**

```code  
  
IO<String> effect = IO.succeed("hi");  
  
JsObj get(int id) { ??? }  
IO<String> effect = IO.succeed(get(1)); //get(1) is invoked before constructing the effect  
  
```  

In both of the above examples, the effect will always compute the same value: either "hi" or the result of calling
`get(1)`. There is no lazynes here, a value is computed right away and used to create the IO effect

**From an exception**

```code  
  
IO<String> effect = IO.fail(new RuntimeException("something went wrong :("));  
  
```  

Like with `succeed`, the effect will always produce the same result, in this case it fails always with the same
exception,
which is instantiated before creating the effect. Do notice that no exception is thrown!

**From a lazy computation or a supplier**

This is a very common case, and you will use it all the time to create effects.

```code  

Suplier<JsObj> computation;  
IO<Long> effect = IO.lazy(computation);  
  
```  

In this example and effect is created but not like in `succeed` and `fail`, **nothing is evaluated**  since a `Supplier`
is lazy. It's very important to notice the difference. On the other hand, each time the  `get` or `result` methods are
invoked a potentially new value can be returned.

**From a callable**

We can think of a `Callable` as lazy computations like `Suppliers`, but with the important difference that they can
fail.

```code  
  
Callable<Long> callable;  
  
IO<Long> effect = IO.task(callable);  
  
```  

**From a CompletableFuture**:

This is a common case when working with APIs that returns futures like the `sendAsync` methods of Java HttpClient
introduced in Java 11

```code  
  
CompletableFuture<JsObj> get(String id){ ??? }  
  
IO<JsObj> effect = IO.effect( () -> get(1) );  
  
```  

Like with `lazy` and `task`, the previous example doesn't evaluate anything to create the effect  
since the effect method takes in a `Supplier`.

In all the above examples, when the `get` or `result`methods are invoked, the values **will be computed on the caller  
thread**. Sometimes we need to control on what thread to perform a computation, especially when it's blocking.  
Whe can specify an executor, or to make use of the **ForkJoin** pool, which is not a problem since **JIO uses
internally
the [ManagedBlocker](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker.html)**
interface, or you can even get benefit from the Loom project and use fibers!

**From a lazy computation or supplier that has to be executed on a specific pool**

```code  
  
Suplier<Long> computation;  
  
IO<Long> effect = IO.lazy(computation,  
                          Executors.newCachedThreadPool()  
                         );  
```  

**From a blocking operation that has to be executed on the ForkJoin Pool by the ManagedBlocker**

```code  
  
Supplier<JsObj> blockingComputation = ???;  
Supplier<JsObj> blockingTask = ???;  

IO<JsObj> effect = IO.managedLazy(blockingComputation);  
IO<JsObj> effect = IO.managedTask(blockingTask);  

```  

**With fibers**

```code  

IO<JsObj> effect = IO.lazy(blockingTask,  
                           Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()  
                           );  
  
```  

**From autoclosable resources**

The `resource` method is used to create an IO effect that manages a resource implementing the `AutoCloseable`
interface. It takes a `Callable` that supplies the closable resource and a mapping function to transform the resource
into a value. This method ensures proper resource management, including automatic closing of the resource, to prevent
memory leaks. It returns an IO effect encapsulating both the resource handling and mapping.

```code   

static <O, I extends AutoCloseable> IO<O> resource(Callable<I> resource,  
                                                   Lambda<I, O> map  
                                                   );  
```  

and an example:

```code  

Callable<FileInputStream> callable = () -> new FileInputStream("example.txt");  
  
// Create an IO effect using the resource method  
IO<String> resultEffect =  
         IO.resource(callable,  
                     inputStream -> {  
                                     try {  
                                        // Read the content of the file and return it as a String  
                                          byte[] bytes = new byte[inputStream.available()];  
                                          inputStream.read(bytes);  
                                          return IO.succeed(new String(bytes, 
                                                            StandardCharsets.UTF_8));  
                                          } 
                                          catch (IOException e) {  
                                             return IO.fail(e);  
                                          }  
                                     }
                     );  
```  

**Other regular IO effects**

```code
  
IO<Boolean> t = IO.TRUE  
  
IO<Boolean> f = IO.FALSE;  
  
IO<String> s = IO.NULL();  
IO<Integer> s = IO.NULL();  
 
```  

The `NULL` method creates an IO effect that always produces a result of null. It is a generic method that captures the
type of the caller, allowing you to create null effects with different result types. This can be useful when you need to
type of the caller, allowing you to create null effects with different result types. This can be useful when you need to
represent a null result in your functional code. These constants, `TRUE` and `FALSE`, represent IO effects that always
succeed with `true` and `false`, respectively.
  
---  

### <a name="Lambdas"><a/> Lambdas

In the world of JIO, working with effectful functions is a common practice. The following functions return `IO` effects,
and you'll often encounter them in your code:

```code

Function<I, IO<O>>

BiFunction<A,B, IO<O>>

```

To make our code more concise and readable, we can give these effectful functions an alias. Let's call them "Lambdas":

```code  
  
interface Lambda<I, O> extends Function<I, IO<O>> {}  
  
interface BiLambda<A, B, O> extends BiFunction<A, B, IO<O>> {}  
  
```  

Lambdas are similar to regular functions, but there's one key difference: they never throw exceptions. In JIO,
exceptions are treated as first-class citizens, just like regular values.

Converting regular functions or predicates into Lambdas is straightforward using the lift methods:

```

Function<Integer, Integer> opposite = n -> -n;
BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> sum = (a,b) -> a + b;
Predicate<Integer> isOdd = n -> n % 2 == 1;

Lambda<Integer, Integer> l1 = Lambda.liftFunction(opposite);
Lambda<Boolean, Integer> l2 = Lambda.liftPredicate(isOdd);
BiLambda<Integer, Integer, Integer> l3 = BiLambda.liftFunction(sum);

```

The `then` method is a powerful feature of the `Lambda` interface in JIO that allows you to compose and sequence effects
in a functional and expressive manner. When you have two `Lambda` instances, you can use the `then` method to create a
new `Lambda` that combines the effects of the two original lambdas. When you apply the composed `Lambda` to an input, it
executes the first `Lambda`, followed by the second `Lambda`, creating a sequence of effects. This composition is
especially useful when building complex workflows or pipelines of operations. It enhances the readability and
expressiveness of your code by chaining together effects in a natural and intuitive way.

```code

Lambda<A,B> first = ???;
Lambda<B,C> second = ???

Lambda<A,C> third = first.then(second);


```

### <a name="Operations-with-effects"><a/> Operations with effects

#### <a name="Making our code more resilient"><a/> Making our code more resilient

**Being persistent!**
Retrying failed operations is a crucial aspect of handling errors effectively in JIO. In real-world
scenarios,errors can sometimes be transient or caused by temporary issues, such as network glitches or resource
unavailability.  
By incorporating retry mechanisms, JIO empowers you to gracefully recover from such errors without compromising the
stability of your application. Whether it's a network request, database query, or any other effect, JIO's built-in
retry functionality allows you to define retry policies, such as exponential backoff or custom strategies, to ensure
that your operations have a higher chance of succeeding. This approach not only enhances the robustness of your
application but also minimizes the impact of transient errors, making JIO a valuable tool for building resilient and
reliable systems.

```code  
  
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
  IO<O> retry(Predicate<Throwable> predicate,  
              RetryPolicy policy  
              );  
    
  IO<O> repeat(Predicate<O> predicate,  
               RetryPolicy policy  
              );  
}  
  
```  

While the `retry` method is primarily used to retry an operation when an error occurs (based on a specified exception
condition), the `repeat` method allows you to repeat an operation based on the result or outcome of the effect itself,  
providing flexibility for scenarios where retries are needed for reasons other than errors.  
Retry policies are created in a very declarative and composable way, for example:

```code  
  
Duration oneHundredMillis = Duration.ofMillis(100);  
  
Duration oneSec = Duration.ofSeconds(1);  
  
// up to five retries waiting 100 ms  
RetryPolicies.constantDelay(oneHundredMillis)
             .append(limitRetries(5))  
  
// during 3 seconds up to 10 times  
RetryPolicies.limitRetries(10)
             .limitRetriesByCumulativeDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(3))  
  
// 5 times without delay and then, if it keeps failing, 
// an incremental delay from 100 ms up to 1 second  
RetryPolicies.limiteRetries(5)
             .followedBy(incrementalDelay(oneHundredMillis)
             .capDelay(oneSec))  
  
```  

There are very interesting policies implemented based
on [this article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/):  exponential backoff, full
jitter, equal jitter, decorrelated jitter etc

**Having a Backup plan!**
In scenarios where errors persist despite retries, JIO offers robust error-handling mechanisms
to ensure your application maintains resilience. Three key methods come into play:

```code  
  
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
  IO<O> recover(Function<Throwable, O> fn);  
    
  IO<O> recoverWith(Lambda<Throwable, O> fn);  
    
  IO<O> fallbackTo(Lambda<Throwable, O> fn);  
  
}  
  
```  

**recover**: This method allows you to gracefully recover from an error by providing a function that maps the
encountered exception to a fallback value of type 'O.' It ensures that your application can continue its operation even
in the face of unexpected errors.

**recoverWith**: This method allows you to gracefully recover from an error by providing a function that maps the
encountered exception to a fallback value of type 'O.' It ensures that your application can continue its operation even
in the face of unexpected errors.

**fallbackTo**: Similar to 'recoverWith,' 'fallbackTo' allows you to switch to an alternative effect (specified by the
provided function) when an error occurs. However, it introduces an important distinction: if the alternative effect also
encounters an error, 'fallbackTo' will return the original error from the first effect. This ensures that error
propagation is maintained while enabling you to gracefully handle errors and fallback to alternative operations when
needed.
  
---  

#### Other common operations

**Being Functional**: JIO encourages a functional programming style with the following methods:

```code  
  
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
    IO<A> map(Function<O, A> fn);  
      
    IO<A> then(Lambda<O, A> fn);  
    
    IO<Void> async();
    
    IO<O> debug();
  
    IO<O> debug(EventBuilder builder);
}  
  
```  

- `map`: Transforms the result of an effect using a provided function, allowing you to map values from one type to
  another.
- `then` (akin to `flatMap` or `bind` in other languages and a core function in monads): Applies a lambda function to  
  the result of the effect, creating a new effect that depends on the previous result. The name 'then' is used here for
  conciseness.
- `async`: The `async` method allows you to execute an effect without waiting for its result and returns
  immediately. It is useful when you are not interested in the outcome of the action and want to trigger it
  asynchronously.
- `debug`: New effect that sends an event to the JFR system after computing the result. You can customize the event with
  a builder.

**Being Impatient!**: Time is of the essence, and JIO offers methods to deal with timeouts:

```code  
  
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
    IO<O> timeout(long time,  
                  TimeUnit unit  
                 );  
      
    IO<O> timeoutOrElse(long time,  
                        TimeUnit unit,  
                        Supplier<O> defaultVal  
                       );    
}  
```  

- `timeout`: Sets a timeout for the effect, allowing you to limit how long you are willing to wait for its completion.
- `timeoutOrElse`: Similar to `timeout`, but with a fallback value that is returned if the timeout is exceeded.

**Being sneaky!**: Sometimes, you need to sneak a peek into the execution of an effect:

```code  
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
    IO<O> peekFailure(Consumer<Throwable> failConsumer);  
      
    IO<O> peekSuccess(Consumer<O> successConsumer);  
      
    IO<O> peek(Consumer<O> successConsumer,  
               Consumer<Throwable> failureConsumer  
              );  
}  
  
```  

- `peekFailure`: Allows you to observe and potentially handle failures by providing a consumer that logs exceptions in
  the JFR (Java Flight Recorder) system.
- `peekSuccess`: Similarly, you can observe and process successful results using a success consumer.
- `peek`: Combines both success and failure consumers, giving you full visibility into the effect's execution.  
  Exceptions occurring here are logged in the JFR system and do not alter the result of the effect.

**I race you!**: When you require a result as quickly as possible among multiple alternatives, and you're uncertain
which one will be the fastest:

```code  
  
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
    static <O> IO<O> race(IO<O> first, IO<O>... others);  
  
}  
  
```  

`race` method returns the result of the first effect that completes (whether it succeeds or fails), allowing you to make
quick decisions based on the outcome.

Sometimes, it is valuable to have fine-grained control over the execution context responsible for computing the values
of effects. JIO provides a set of methods with the 'on' suffix to cater to this specific need. These methods allow you  
to specify the execution context or thread pool in which the effect's computation should occur, providing you with
control over concurrency and resource allocation. Here are the key methods with the 'on' suffix:

```code  

public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  
  
    IO<O> recoverWithOn(Lambda<Throwable, O> fn,  
                        Executor executor  
                        );  
      
    IO<O> retryOn(Predicate<Throwable> predicate,  
                  RetryPolicy policy,  
                  Executor executor  
                  );  
      
    <Q> IO<Q> thenOn(Lambda<O, Q> fn,  
                     Executor executor  
                     );  
      
    IO<O> fallbackToOn(Lambda<Throwable, O> lambda,  
                       Executor executor  
                      );  
}  
```

## Expressions

**Using expressions and function composition is how we deal with complexity in Functional Programming**.  
With the following expressions, you will have a comprehensive toolkit to model effects, combine them in powerful ways,
and tame complexity effectively.

### IfElseExp

The `IfElseExp` expression allows you to conditionally choose between two computations based on a predicate. If the  
predicate evaluates to true, the consequence is computed, and if it's false, the alternative computation is chosen. Both
the consequence and alternative are represented as lazy computations of IO effects.

```code  
  
import jio.IfElseExp;  
  
IO<O> exp = IfElseExp.<O>predicate(IO<Boolean> condition)  
                     .consequence(Supplier<IO<O>> consequence)  
                     .alternative(Supplier<IO<O>> alternative);  
  
  
```  

In this code, the `consequence` and `alternative` parameters are represented as `Supplier` instances, which means they
are not
computed during the construction of the expression but rather evaluated only when needed, based on the result of the
condition. This deferred execution allows for efficient conditional evaluation of IO effects.

### SwitchExp

Your original sentence is mostly correct but could benefit from a minor improvement for clarity:

The `SwitchExp` expression simulates the behavior of a switch construct, enabling multiple pattern-value branches. It
evaluates an effect or a value of type `I` and facilitates the use of multiple clauses based on the evaluation.
The `match` method compares the value or effect with patterns and selects the corresponding lambda (which takes in the
value of type `I`). Patterns can encompass values, lists of values, or even predicates. It's possible to specify a
default branch, in case no pattern matches the input (otherwise the expression is reduced to `IO.NULL`).

```code  
  
// matches a value of type I  
  
IO<O> exp =  
          SwitchExp<I,O>.eval(I value)  
                      .match(I pattern1, Lambda<I,O> lambda1,  
                             I pattern2, Lambda<I,O> lambda2,  
                             I pattern3, Lambda<I,O> lambda3,  
                             Lambda<I,O> otherwise          //optional
                            );  
  
// matches an effect of type I  
  
IO<O> exp=  
        SwitchExp<I, O>.eval(IO<I> effect)  
                       .match(I pattern1, Lambda<I,O> lambda1,  
                              I pattern2, Lambda<I,O> lambda2,  
                              I pattern3, Lambda<I,O> lambda3,
                              Lambda<I,O> otherwise         //optional
                             );  
  
  
// For example, the following expression reduces to "3 is Wednesday"  
  
IO<O> exp=  
         SwitchExp<String>.eval(3)  
                          .match(1, n -> IO.succedd(n + " is Monday"),  
                                 2, n -> IO.succedd(n + " is Tuesday"),  
                                 3, n -> IO.succedd(n + " is Wednesday"),  
                                 4, n -> IO.succedd(n + " is Thursday"),  
                                 5, n -> IO.succedd(n + " is Friday"),  
                                 n -> IO.succedd(n + " is weekend")  
                                );  
```  

The same as before but using lists instead of constants as patterns.

```code  
  
IO<O> exp =  
          SwitchExp<I, O>.eval(I value)  
                         .match(List<I> pattern1, Lambda<I,O> lambda1,  
                                List<I> pattern2, Lambda<I,O> lambda2,  
                                List<I> pattern3, Lambda<I,O> lambda3,  
                                Lamda<I,O> otherwise  
                                );  
  
// For example, the following expression reduces to "20 falls into the third week"  
IO<O> exp=  
         SwitchExp<Integer, String>.eval(20)  
                                   .match(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), 
                                          n -> IO.succeed(n + " falls into the first week"),  
                                          List.of(8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), 
                                          n -> IO.succeed(n + " falls into the second week"),  
                                          List.of(15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), 
                                          n -> IO.succeed(n + " falls into the third week"),  
                                          List.of(21, 12, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27), 
                                          n -> IO.succeedd(n + " falls into the forth week"),  
                                          n -> IO.succeed(n + " falls into the last days of the month")  
                                         );  
```  

Last but not least, you can use predicates as patterns instead of values or list of values:

```code  
  
IO<O> exp=  
        SwitchExp<I, O>.eval(IO<I> value)  
                       .match(Predicate<I> pattern1, Lambda<I,O> lambda1,  
                              Predicate<I> pattern2, Lambda<I,O> lambda2,  
                              Predicate<I> pattern3, Lambda<I,O> lambda3
                              );  
  
// For example, the following expression reduces to the default value: "20 is greater or equal to ten"  
  
IO<O> exp=  
        SwitchExp<Integer, String>.eval(IO.succeed(20))  
                                  .match(n -> n < 5, 
                                         n -> IO.succeed(n + "is lower than five"),  
                                         n -> n < 10, 
                                         n -> IO.succeed(n + "is lower than ten"),  
                                         n-> n > 10, 
                                         n -> IO.succeed(n + "is greater or equal to ten")  
                                         );  
```  

### CondExp

`CondExp` is a set of branches and a default effect. Each branch consists of an effect that computes a boolean (the  
condition) and its associated effect. The expression is reduced to the value of the first branch with a true
condition, making the order of branches significant. If no condition is true, it computes the default effect if
specified
(otherwise the expression is reduced to `IO.NULL`)

```code  
  
IO<O> exp=  
    CondExp.<O>seq(IO<Boolean> cond1, Supplier<IO<O>> effect1,  
                   IO<Boolean> cond2, Supplier<IO<O>> effect2,  
                   IO<Boolean> cond3, Supplier<IO<O>> effect3,  
                   Supplier<IO<O>> otherwise                 //optional             
                  );  
  
  
IO<O> exp =  
    CondExp.<O>par(IO<Boolean> cond1, Supplier<IO<O>> effect1,  
                   IO<Boolean> cond2, Supplier<IO<O>> effect2,  
                   IO<Boolean> cond3, Supplier<IO<O>> effect3,  
                   Supplier<IO<O>> otherwise                //optional  
                  );  
  
```  

### AllExp and AnyExp

`AllExp` and `AnyExp` provide idiomatic boolean expressions for "AND" and "OR." They allow you to compute multiple  
boolean effects, either sequentially or in parallel.

```code  
  
IO<Boolean> allPar = AllExp.par(IO<Boolean> cond1, IO<Boolean> cond2,....);  
IO<Boolean> allSeq = AllExp.seq(IO<Boolean> cond1, IO<Boolean> cond2,....);  
  
IO<Boolean> anyPar = AnyExp.par(IO<Boolean> cond1, IO<Boolean> cond2,...);  
IO<Boolean> anySeq = AnyExp.seq(IO<Boolean> cond1, IO<Boolean> cond2,...);  
  
```  

You can also create AllExp or AnyExp from streams of IO<Boolean> using the `parCollector` and `seqCollector`

```code

Lambda<Vehicle, Boolean> isFerrari = ???

List<Vehicle> vehicles = ???;

AllExp allFerrariPar = vehicles.stream()
                               .map(isFerrary)
                               .collector(AllExp.parCollector());

AllExp allFerrariSeq = vehicles.stream()
                               .map(isFerrary)
                               .collector(AllExp.seqCollector());
                               
AnyExp anyFerrariSeq = vehicles.stream()
                               .map(isFerrary)
                               .collector(AnyExp.seqCollector());                               


```

### PairExp and TripleExp

`PairExp` and `TripleExp` allow you to zip effects into tuples of two and three elements, respectively.
You can compute each element either in parallel or sequentially.

```code  
  
IO<Pair<A, B> pairPar = PairExp.par(IO<A> effect1, 
                                    IO<B> effect2);  
  
IO<Pair<A, B> pairSeq = PairExp.seq(IO<A> effect1, 
                                    IO<B> effect2);  
  
IO<Triple<A, B, C> triplePar = 
    TripleExp.par(IO<A> effect1,
                  IO<B> effect2,
                  IO<C> effect3);  
  
IO<Triple<A, B, C> tripleSeq = 
    TripleExp.seq(IO<A> effect1,
                  IO<B> effect2,
                  IO<C> effect3);  
  
```  

### JsObjExp and JsArrayExp

`JsObjExp` and `JsArrayExp` are data structures resembling raw JSON. You can compute their values sequentially or in  
parallel. You can mix all the expressions discussed so far and nest them, providing you with immense flexibility and  
power in handling complex data structures.

```code  
  
IfElseExp<JsStr> a = IfElseExp.<JsStr>predicate(IO<Boolean> cond1)  
                              .consequence(Supplier<IO<JsStr>> consequence)  
                              .alternative(Supplier<IO<JsStr>> alternative);  
  
JsArrayExp b = 
    JsArrayExp.seq(SwitchExp<Integer, JsValue>.match(n)  
                                              .patterns(n -> n <= 0, Supplier<IO<JsValue>> effect1,  
                                                        n -> n  > 0, Supplier<IO<JsValue>> effect2
                                                       ),  
                   CondExp.par(IO<Boolean> cond2, Supplier<IO<JsValue>> effect3,  
                               IO<Boolean> cond3, Supplier<IO<JsValue>> effect4,  
                               Supplier<IO<JsValue>> otherwise  
                              )  
                 );  
  
JsObjExp c = JsObjExp.seq("d", AnyExp.seq(IO<Boolean> cond1, IO<Boolean> cond2)  
                                     .map(JsBool::of),  
                          "e", AllExp.par(IO<Boolean> cond2, IO<Boolean> cond3)  
                                     .map(JsBool::of),  
                          "f", JsArrayExp.par(IO<JsValue> effect5, IO<JsValue> effect6)  
                          );  
  
JsObjExp exp = JsObjExp.par("a",a,  
                            "b",b,  
                            "c",c  
                           );  
  
JsObj json = exp.result();  
  
```  

Here are some key points about the code example:

1. **Readability**: The code is relatively easy to read and understand, thanks to the fluent API style provided by
   JIO's expressions. This makes it straightforward to follow the logic of constructing a `JsObj` with multiple
   key-value pairs.

2. **Modularity**: Each key-value pair is constructed separately, making it easy to add, modify, or remove components
   without affecting the others. This modularity is a significant advantage when dealing with complex data structures.

3. **Parallelism**: The example demonstrates the ability to perform computations in parallel when constructing  
   the `JsObj`. By using expressions like `JsObjExp.par`, you can take advantage of multicore processors and improve
   performance.

4. **Nesting**: The example also shows that you can nest expressions within each other, allowing for recursive data  
   structures. This is valuable when dealing with deeply nested expressions or other complex data formats.

Overall, the code example effectively illustrates how JIO's expressions enable you to create, manipulate, and compose
functional effects to handle complex data scenarios. It highlights the conciseness and expressiveness of the library  
when dealing with such tasks.

### ListExp

Represents an expression that is reduced to a list of values. You can create ListExp expressions using the `seq`
method to evaluate effects sequentially or using the `par` method to evaluate effects in parallel. If one effect
fails, the entire expression fails.

```code

ListExp<String> par = ListExp.par(IO<String> effect1, IO<String> effect2, ...)

ListExp<Integer> seq = ListExp.seq(IO<String> effect3, IO<String> effect3, ...)

List<String> xs = par.result();
List<Integer> ys = seq.result();

```

It's possible to create ListExp from stream of effects of the same type using the collectors
`parCollector` and `seqCollector`:

```code

Lambda<String, Person> getPersonFromId = ???;

List<String> ids = ???;

ListExp<Person> xs = ids.stream()
                        .filter(id -> id > 0)
                        .map(getPersonFromId)
                        .collect(ListExp.parCollector());

List<Person> persons = xs.result();                            

```

## <a name="Clocks"><a/> Clocks

In functional programming, it's crucial to maintain a clear separation between inputs and outputs of a function.
When dealing with time-related operations, such as retrieving the current date or time, it becomes even more critical
to adhere to this principle. This is where the concept of clocks in JIO comes into play.
A clock in JIO is essentially a supplier that returns a numeric value, representing time. There are three types of  
clocks available:

- Realtime: This clock is affected by Network Time Protocol (NTP) adjustments and can move both forwards and backward
  in time. It is implemented using the System.currentTimeMillis() method. Realtime clocks are typically used when you
  need to work with the current wall-clock time.
- Monotonic: Monotonic clocks are useful for measuring time intervals and performing time-related comparisons. They
  are not affected by NTP adjustments and provide a consistent and continuous time source. Monotonic clocks are
  implemented using the System.nanoTime() method.
- Custom: JIO allows you to create your custom clocks. Custom clocks are particularly valuable for testing scenarios  
  where you want to control the flow of time, possibly simulating the past or future.

```code  
  
sealed interface Clock extends Supplier<Long> permits Monotonic,RealTime, CustomClock {}  
  
```  

Every time you write _new Date()_ or _Instant.now()_ in the body of a method or function, you are creating a side
effect.  
Remember that in FP, all the inputs must appear in the signature of a function. Dealing with time, it's even more  
important. Also, it's impossible to control by any test the value of that timestamp which leads to code difficult to  
test.

### Why It Matters

The reason why dealing with time as an input is crucial in functional programming is to make code more predictable,  
testable, and less error-prone. Consider the following scenario, which is a common source of bugs:

**Bug Scenario**:

```code  
public class PaymentService {  
    public boolean processPayment(double amount) {  
        // Get the current date and time  
        Instant currentTime = Instant.now();  
          
        // Perform payment processing logic  
        // ...  
          
        // Check if the payment was made within a specific time window  
        Instant windowStart = currentTime.minus(Duration.ofHours(1));  
        Instant windowEnd = currentTime.plus(Duration.ofHours(1));  
          
        return paymentTime.isAfter(windowStart) && paymentTime.isBefore(windowEnd);  
    }  
}  
  
```  

**Better Version Using a Clock**  
A better approach is to pass a clock as a method parameter:

```code  
  
public class PaymentService {  
    public boolean processPayment(double amount, Clock clock) {  
        // Get the current time from the provided clock  
        Instant currentTime = Instant.ofEpochMilli(clock.get());  
  
        // Perform payment processing logic  
        // ...  
          
        // Check if the payment was made within a specific time window  
        Instant windowStart = currentTime.minus(Duration.ofHours(1));  
        Instant windowEnd = currentTime.plus(Duration.ofHours(1));  
  
        return paymentTime.isAfter(windowStart) && paymentTime.isBefore(windowEnd);  
    }  
}  
  
  
```  

In this improved version, we pass a Clock object as a parameter to the processPayment method. This approach offers  
several advantages:

- Testability: During testing, you can provide a custom clock that allows you to control the current time, making
  tests more predictable and reliable.
- Predictability: The behavior of the method is consistent regardless of when it's called since it depends on the  
  provided clock.

By using a clock as a parameter, you enhance the reliability and maintainability of your code, especially in scenarios  
where time plays a critical role.

## <a name="Debugging-and-JFR-integration"><a/> Debugging and Java Flight Recorder (JFR) Integration

### Why I chose JFR

In the world of Java, there has long been a multitude of logging libraries and frameworks, each with its strengths
and limitations. However, the introduction of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) has been a game-changer. JFR is a native and
highly efficient profiling and event recording mechanism embedded within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its native
integration means it operates seamlessly with your Java applications, imposing minimal performance overhead. JFR
provides unparalleled visibility into the inner workings of your code, allowing you to capture and analyze events with
precision.

Unlike external logging libraries, JFR doesn't rely on third-party dependencies or introduce additional complexity to  
your projects. By using JFR within JIO, you harness the power of this built-in tool to gain deep insights into the  
behavior of your functional effects and expressions, all while keeping your codebase clean and efficient. JFR is the  
dream solution for Java developers seeking robust debugging and monitoring capabilities with minimal hassle."

Debugging and monitoring the behavior of your JIO-based applications is essential for troubleshooting, performance  
optimization, and gaining insights into your functional effects and expressions. JIO provides comprehensive support
for debugging and integration with Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to capture and analyze events.
  
---  

### Debugging Individual Effects

You have the option to enable debugging for individual effects using the `debug` method. When this method is used, a new
effect is created that generates a `RecordedEvent` and sends it to the Flight Recorder system. You can also customize
the event by providing an `EventBuilder`. Here's an overview:

The `IO` class has the following methods for debugging:

```code
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  

    IO<O> debug();  
   
    IO<O> debug(EventBuilder<O> builder);  
}
```

The resulting JFR event is defined as follows:

```code
import jdk.jfr.*;

@Label("jio-eval-expression")
@Name("jio.exp")
@Category({"JIO"})
@Description("JIO expressions and subexpressions results")
class ExpEvent extends Event {

    @Label("exp")
    public String expression;
    
    @Label("value")
    public String value;
    
    @Label("context")
    public String context;
    
    @Label("result")
    public String result;
    public enum RESULT {SUCCESS, FAILURE}
    
    @Label("exception")
    public String exception;

}
```

You can use the [JIO debugger](#junit) to print the events sent to the JFR system. Here's an example:

```code
@RegisterExtension
static Debugger debugger = Debugger of (Duration.ofSeconds(1));

@Test
public void test() {
    
    Integer value = IO.succeed(10).debug().result();

    // result() would throw an exception!
    CompletableFuture<Integer> failure = 
        IO.<Integer>fail(new RuntimeException("JIO is great!"))
          .debug()
          .get();
}
```

The result includes events like this:

```text
event: eval, expression: Val, result: SUCCESS, output: 10
duration: 2,693 ms, context: , thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-24T23:42:51.6197205+02:00

event: eval, expression: Val, result: FAILURE, output: java.lang.RuntimeException: JIO is great!
duration: 59,291 µs, context: , thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-24T23:49:01.073597625+02:00
```

The event type is always "eval" (for evaluation), and the expression is "Val" (for Value), reflecting the evaluation of
two irreducible expressions. The result is "SUCCESS" for the first evaluation, and "FAILURE" for the second. The context
in both cases is the default (an empty string).

You can customize event messages using an `EventBuilder`. For example:

```code
EventBuilder<Integer> eb =
    EventBuilder.<Integer>of("other_exp_name", "fun")
        .withSuccessOutput(output -> "XXX")
        .withFailureOutput(Throwable::getMessage);

Integer value = IO.succeed(10).debug(eb).result();

// result() would throw an exception!
CompletableFuture<Integer> failure = IO.<Integer>fail(new RuntimeException("JIO is great!"))
    .debug(eb)
    .get();
```

The result with this customization is:

```text
event: eval, expression: other_exp_name, result: SUCCESS, output: XXX
duration: 4,071 ms, context: fun, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-24T23:55:36.360573875+02:00

event: eval, expression: other_exp_name, result: FAILURE, output: JIO is great!
duration: 38,750 µs, context: fun, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-24T23:55:36.364976084+02:00
```

The `EventBuilder` provides key points for customization, including specifying event messages for successful and failed
computations and associating events with specific expressions and contexts.

### Debugging Expressions

JIO's debugging capabilities extend beyond individual effects. You can attach a debug mechanism to each operand of an
expression using the `debugEach` method. This allows you to monitor and log the execution of each operand individually.
Here's an overview:

```code
public abstract class IO<O> extends Supplier<CompletableFuture<O>> {  

    Exp<O> debugEach(final EventBuilder<O> builder);  

    Exp<O> debugEach(final String context);  
}
```

By using `debugEach`, you can gain insights into the behavior of complex expressions and identify any issues or
bottlenecks that may arise during execution. This mechanism is recursive, meaning that if subexpressions are expressions
themselves, `debugEach` will be called on them, copying the context of the event (if specified).

You can also provide an `EventBuilder` or a descriptive context to customize the debug events for each operand.

Here's an example of using `debugEach`:

```code

@RegisterExtension
static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

@Test
public void test() {

    Supplier<Boolean> isLowerCase = BoolGen.arbitrary().sample();
    Supplier<String> lowerCase = Combinators.oneOf("a", "e", "i", "o", "u").sample();
    Supplier<String> upperCase = Combinators.oneOf("A", "E", "I", "O", "U").sample();

    SwitchExp<String, String> match =
        SwitchExp.<String, String>eval(IfElseExp.<String>predicate(IO.lazy(isLowerCase))
            .consequence(() -> IO.lazy(lowerCase))
            .alternative(() -> IO.lazy(upperCase))
        )
            .match(List.of("a", "e", "i", "o", "u"),
                s -> IO.succeed("%s %s".formatted(s, s.toUpperCase())),
                List of("A", "E", "I", "O", "U"),
                s -> IO.succeed("%s %s".formatted(s, s.toLowerCase()))
            )
            .debugEach("context");

    System.out.println("The output is " + match.result());

}
```

The result after executing this test includes events related to each operand:

```text
The output is E e

event: eval, expression: SwitchExp-eval-predicate, result: SUCCESS, output: false
duration: 2,535 ms, context: context, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-15T10:32:58.749536666+02:00

event: eval, expression: SwitchExp-eval-alternative, result: SUCCESS, output: E
duration: 12,541 µs, context: context, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-15T10:32:58.752555+02:00

event: eval, expression: SwitchExp-eval, result: SUCCESS, output: E
duration: 3,213 ms, context: context, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-15T10:32:58.749529541+02:00

event: eval, expression: SwitchExp-branch[1], result: SUCCESS, output: E e
duration: 7,250 µs, context: context, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-15T10:32:58.75355575+02:00

event: eval, expression: SwitchExp, result: SUCCESS, output: E e
duration: 4,057 ms, context: context, thread: main, event-start-time: 2023-10-15T10:32:58.749524+02:00

```

As mentioned earlier, the `debugExp` function is recursive. Since the `eval` subexpression of the `SwitchExp` is
an `IfElseExp`, you can see events associated with it: `SwitchExp-eval-predicate` and `SwitchExp-eval-alternative`.

## <a name="jioexpchatgp"><a/> What ChatGPT think of jio-exp?

I asked ChatGPT about jio-exp and this is what I got.

JIO appears to be a Java library that aims to provide tools and abstractions for functional programming in Java. It
introduces a set of classes and expressions that can help developers work with effects, control flow, and time-related
operations in a functional and composable way. Here are some key points based on the information you shared:

1. **Functional Programming Tools**: JIO provides tools and abstractions for developers who want to apply functional
   programming concepts in Java. It offers expressive ways to work with effects, manage control flow, and handle
   time-related operations.

2. **Expressive Expressions**: The library introduces various expressions, such as `IfElseExp`, `SwitchExp`, `CondExp`,
   and others, which allow developers to model complex logic in a readable and composable manner. These expressions make
   it easier to work with functional constructs.

3. **Clocks for Time Management**: JIO introduces the concept of clocks, which can be used to manage time-related
   operations in a functional way. It provides three types of clocks: Realtime, Monotonic, and Custom, giving developers
   flexibility in handling time in their applications.

4. **Debugging and JFR Integration**: JIO offers debugging support for individual effects and expressions. It integrates
   with Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to capture and analyze events, making it easier to troubleshoot and monitor the
   behavior of functional effects.

5. **Testing and Testability**: The ability to pass custom clocks and control time is highlighted as a way to improve
   testability in applications. By making time an explicit input, developers can create more predictable and reliable
   tests.

6. **Modularity and Parallelism**: JIO encourages modularity by allowing developers to work on individual components
   without affecting others. It also supports parallelism for improved performance.

7. **Maven Dependency**: It provides clear installation instructions and includes a Maven dependency for easy
   integration into Java projects.

In summary, JIO appears to be a library designed to enhance functional programming capabilities in Java, with a focus on
readability, expressiveness, and testability. It provides tools to manage effects, control flow, and time-related
operations, along with debugging and JFR integration for monitoring and troubleshooting. Its modularity and focus on
testability are likely to be appreciated by developers looking to apply functional programming principles in Java.

## <a name="jio-http"><a/> jio-http

[![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.imrafaelmerino/jio-http/1.0.0-RC3)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.imrafaelmerino/jio-http/1.0.0-RC3/jar "jio-http")

### <a name="httpserver"><a/> HTTP server

In JIO, you can build and deploy HTTP servers using the `HttpServerBuilder`. This builder is a versatile tool for
defining and launching HTTP servers for various purposes, including testing. The `HttpServerBuilder` allows you to
create `HttpServer` or `HttpsServer` instances with ease.

**Specifying the Request Handlers**

To handle specific URI paths, you can associate each path with an HTTP request handler. For each path, specify a handler
that will be invoked for incoming requests.

```code
HttpHandler handler = ???; 

HttpHandler handler1 = ???; 

HttpServerBuilder serverBuilder = HttpServerBuilder.of("/your-path", handler,
                                                       "/your-path1", handler1);

```

**Specifying an Executor**

When creating an `HttpServer` is possible to specify an `Executor`. All HTTP requests received by the server will
be handled in tasks provided to this executor. You can set the executor using the `withExecutor(Executor executor)`
method.

```code
Executor executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor(); 

serverBuilder.withExecutor(executor);
```

**Setting the Socket Backlog**

The `HttpServerBuilder` allows you to specify the socket backlog, which defines the number of incoming connections that
can be queued for acceptance. You can set the backlog using the `withBacklog(int backlog)` method.

```code
int backlog = ???; // Your desired backlog value

serverBuilder.withBacklog(backlog);
```

**Enabling SSL**

If you want to accept only SSL connections:

```code

HttpsConfigurator httpsConfigurator = ???;

serverBuilder.withSSL(httpsConfigurator);

```

**Recording JFR Events (Java Flight Recorder)**

By default, the `HttpServer` records Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events for HTTP requests, which can be helpful for
debugging and performance analysis. However, you can disable this feature if needed using the `withoutRecordedEvents()`
method.

```code
serverBuilder.withoutRecordedEvents();
```

**Starting the server on a Specific Port**

The start methods allow you to create and start the HTTP server at your convenience.

```code
String host = "localhost"; 
int port = 8080; 

HttpServer server = serverBuilder.start(host, port);
```

**Starting the server on a Random Available Port**

You can even pick a random port, which is useful for local testing as we'll see later.

```code
int startPort = 8000; 

int endPort = 9000;   

HttpServer server = serverBuilder.startAtRandom(startPort, endPort);
```

In conclusion, with the `HttpServerBuilder`, you can easily create and deploy HTTP/HTTPS servers in your JIO
applications,
making it convenient for testing and development. Whether you need to specify an executor, add request handlers, or
start on specific or random ports, this builder provides the flexibility and functionality to meet your server
deployment needs.

Find below a complete example and the events sent to the JFR system:

```code
 import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
 
 HttpHandler tokenHandler = 
            PostStub.of(BodyStub.gen(JsObjGen.of("access_token", JsStrGen.alphanumeric(10, 10))
                                             .map(JsObj::toString)),
                        StatusCodeStub.cons(200)
                        );
 HttpHandler thankHandler = 
        GetStub.of(BodyStub.cons("your welcome!"),
                   StatusCodeStub.gen(Combinators.freq(Pair.of(5, IntGen.arbitrary(200, 299)),
                                                       Pair.of(1, Gen.cons(401))))
                  );
 
 HttpServer server = 
        HttpServerBuilder.of(Map.of("/token", tokenHandler,
                                    "/thanks", thankHandler
                                    )
                            )
                         .startAtRandom(8000, 9000);

```

The example code sets up a test environment for a HTTP client with OAuth support (Client Credentials flow). It uses
stubs from [jio-test](#jio-test) to create HTTP handlers for testing different scenarios. The `tokenHandler` simulates
an OAuth token
request, and the `thankHandler` simulates a response that includes a "your welcome!" message. The status code for
the `thankHandler` is generated to return a 401 response approximately 1 out of 6 times, simulating the case where the
access token has expired. The `HttpServerBuilder` is used to create an HTTP server on a random port to handle these
requests. This setup allows testing of various scenarios, including token expiration handling.

### <a name="httpclient"><a/> HTTP client

In JIO, I create an HTTP client on top of the Java HttpClient introduced in Java 11. JIO's goal is to work with Java's
native objects (no abstraction on top of them) while treating errors as normal values (Lambdas can help us here!). This
approach allows us to define an HTTP exchange as a function, where the input is an HTTP request (modeled
using `java.net.http.HttpRequest.Builder`), and the output is an `IO` object representing the response. The function
signature for this is as follows:

```code

<O> Lambda<HttpRequest.Builder, HttpResponse<O>>

```

To make this type more concise, we give it an alias in JIO-HTTP. We call the previous function an `HttpLambda<O>`,
where `O` represents the response body type (typically `String` or `byte[]`):

```code

interface HttpLambda<O> extends Lambda<HttpRequest.Builder, HttpResponse<O>> {}

```

JIO-HTTP offers an HTTP client with various options for handling different response types. Depending on your desired
response type, you can use one of the following methods:

```java

public interface JioHttpClient {

    HttpLambda<String> ofString();

    HttpLambda<byte[]> ofBytes();

    HttpLambda<Void> discarding();

    <T> HttpLambda<T> bodyHandler(final HttpResponse.BodyHandler<T> handler);

}


```

You can create and configure a `JioHttpClient` using the builder `JioHttpClientBuilder`.
This builder allows you to customize the HTTP client, including specifying a retry policy, a retry predicate for
selecting what errors to retry, and enabling or disabling the recording of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) events for HTTP
requests and responses. JFR event recording is enabled by default:

- `withRetryPolicy`: Sets a default retry policy for handling exceptions during requests.
    - `withRetryPredicate`: Sets a default predicate for selectively applying the retry policy based on the type or
      condition of the exception.
    - `withoutRecordEvents`: Disables the recording of JFR events for HTTP requests.

Below is a complete example, making requests to the famous PetStore service, illustrating how to use create and use the
JIO HTTP client.

```java

public class TestHttpClient {

    @RegisterExtension
    static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

    static JioHttpClient client =
            JioHttpClientBuilder.of(HttpClient.newBuilder()
                                              .connectTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(300))
                                   )
                                .setRetryPolicy(RetryPolicies.incrementalDelay(Duration.ofMillis(10))
                                                             .append(RetryPolicies.limitRetries(5)))
                                .setRetryPredicate(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT.or(NETWORK_UNREACHABLE))
                                .build();

    static BiFunction<String, String, HttpRequest.Builder> GET =
            (entity, id) -> HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                                       .GET()
                                       .uri(URI.create("https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/%s/%s".formatted(entity,
                                                                                                        id)));


    @Test
    public void testGetPetStoreMethods() {

        IO<HttpResponse<String>> getPet = client.ofString().apply(GET.apply("pet", "1"));

        IO<HttpResponse<String>> getOrder = client.ofString().apply(GET.apply("store/order", "1"));

        List<Integer> status = ListExp.par(getPet, getOrder)
                                      .map(responses -> responses.stream()
                                                                 .map(HttpResponse::statusCode)
                                                                 .toList()
                                          )
                                      .result();

        Assertions.assertTrue(status.size() == 2);


    }

}

```

One possible outcome is

```text
Started JFR stream for 2,000 sg in Properties

event: httpclient-req, result: FAILURE, exception: java.net.http.HttpConnectTimeoutException:HTTP connect timed out
duration: 321,280 ms method: GET, uri: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/store/order/1, req-counter: 2

```

Some errors occurred due to the connection timeout being too short for this particular scenario. Thankfully, the
retry mechanism came to the rescue! Additionally, the `HttpExceptions` class provides numerous predicates to help
identify the most common errors that can occur during request execution.

### <a name="oauth"><a/> OAUTH HTTP client

jio-http provides support for client credentials flow OAuth.
Here are the possible customizations for the `ClientCredsBuilder` builder:

1. The request sent to the server to get the access token:
    - `accessTokenReq` parameter: A lambda that takes the regular HTTP client and returns the HTTP request to get the
      token. There is a factory method to build a specific request in the class `AccessTokenRequest`. For example one
      that takes in the client id and secret and an `URI` to make the following request:
      ```shell

      curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" \
                   -H "Authorization: Basic ${Base64(ClientId:ClientSecret)}" \
                   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
                   -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
                   https://host:port/token

      ```

    2. A function to read the access token from the server response:
        - `getAccessToken` parameter: A lambda that takes the server response and returns the OAuth token. You can use
          the
          existing implementation `GetAccessToken`, which parses the response into a `JsObj` and returns the access
          token
          located at the "access_token" field. If the token is not found, the lambda fails with the
          exception `AccessTokenNotFound`. The `GetAccessToken` class is a singleton with a private constructor, and you
          can
          use the `GetAccessToken.DEFAULT` instance for this purpose.

    3. A predicate that checks if the access token needs to be refreshed:
        - `refreshTokenPredicate` parameter: A predicate that checks the response to determine if the access token needs
          to be refreshed.

    4. The authorization header name:
        - `authorizationHeaderName` field: The name of the authorization header, which is set to "Authorization" by
          default.

    5. A function to create the authorization header value from the access token:
        - `authorizationHeaderValue` field: A function that takes the access token and returns the authorization header
          value. By default, it is set to "Bearer ${Access Token}".

You can customize these options when creating an instance of `ClientCredsBuilder` to configure the
behavior of the OAuth client credentials flow support in your HTTP client. Since you need a JioHttpClientBuilder
instance to create `ClientCredsBuilder`, you can specify retry policies and predicates, and of course
you can disable the recording of JFR events for every exchange.

The builder returns an instance of `ClientCredsClient`, which is an implementation of `OauthHttpClient`:

```code
package jio.http.client.oauth;

import jio.http.client.HttpLambda;
import jio.http.client.JioHttpClient;

import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

public interface OauthHttpClient extends JioHttpClient {

   // since it extends JioHttpClient: ofString() ofBytes() and so on are available as well!

    HttpLambda<String> oauthOfString();

    HttpLambda<byte[]> oauthOfBytes();

    HttpLambda<Void> oauthDiscarding();

    <T> HttpLambda<T> oauthBodyHandler(final HttpResponse.BodyHandler<T> handler);

}


```

The advantage of the `oauthXXX` methods is that they handle all token retrieval and refresh requests on behalf of the
client, relieving developers from the burden of implementing these processes.

Here's an illustrative example:

```code
import java.net.URI;

public class TestOauthHttpClient {

    @RegisterExtension
    static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

    //HttpServer creation from one of the previous examples!!!

    static JioHttpClientBuilder clientBuilder =
            JioHttpClientBuilder.of(HttpClient.newBuilder()
                                              .connectTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(300)))
                                .withRetryPolicy(RetryPolicies.incrementalDelay(Duration.ofMillis(10))
                                                              .append(RetryPolicies.limitRetries(5)))
                                .withRetryPredicate(CONNECTION_TIMEOUT.or(NETWORK_UNREACHABLE));

    static OauthHttpClient client =
            ClientCredsBuilder.of(clientBuilder,
                                  AccessTokenRequest.of("client_id",
                                                        "client_secret",
                                                        URI.create("http://localhost:%s/token".formatted(port))
                                                        ), 
                                  GetAccessToken.DEFAULT, //token in access_token key in a JSON
                                  resp ->resp.statusCode() == 401 // if 401 go for a new token
                                  )
                               .build();

    @Test
    public void testOuth() {
        client.oauthOfString()
              .apply(HttpRequest.newBuilder().uri(URI.create("http://localhost:%s/thanks".formatted(port))))
              .repeat(resp -> true, RetryPolicies.limitRetries(10))
              .result();
    }

}

```

Let's pick some events from the console. Notice that both the events from the server and the client are
printed.

```text

```

In the server event generated during the token request, you can observe the Authorization header sent by the client,
with the value "Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=". If we decode this value from Base64, we obtain "client_id:
client_secret," which corresponds to the exact values we provided when configuring
the `ClientCredsBuilder`.

## <a name="jio-test"><a/> jio-test

[![Maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.imrafaelmerino/jio-test/1.0.0-RC3)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.imrafaelmerino/jio-test/1.0.0-RC3/jar "jio-test")

### <a name="junit"><a/> Junit integration

To enable debugging of various components in your tests, Jio provides a JUnit extension called `Debugger`. This
extension offers the flexibility to enable and configure debugging for different components, such as HTTP clients, HTTP
servers, MongoDB clients, and expression evaluation.

#### Enabling Debugging

The `Debugger` extension allows you to enable and configure debugging for specific components in your JUnit tests. You
can control the duration of debugging and specify custom debugging configurations.

#### Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the `Debugger` extension in your JUnit test class:

```java
import jio.test.junit.Debugger;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.RegisterExtension;

public class MyTest {

    @RegisterExtension
    static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

    // Your test methods go here
}
```

In this example, we've created a `Debugger` instance with a duration of 2 seconds. This means that the test execution
will be monitored for debugging events for a duration of 2 seconds.

#### Configuring Debugging

You can configure debugging by specifying a custom Java Flight Recorder (JFR) configuration. Most of the time, leaving
this parameter empty and using the default configuration is sufficient. The debugging duration determines how long the
test execution will be monitored for debugging events.

#### Component-Specific Debugging

Each component's debugging events are collected from the JFR system via Jio, providing insights into the behavior of
various components during test execution. The Debugger extension uses the `jdk.jfr.consumer.RecordingStream` internally
to
capture and analyze JFR events.

- `jio.exp`: For expression evaluation debugging.
- `jio.httpclient`: For debugging HTTP clients.
- `jio.httpserver`: For debugging HTTP servers.
- `jio.mongodb`: For debugging MongoDB clients.

#### Important Considerations

It's essential to set an appropriate debugging duration to avoid unnecessary delays in test execution. Keep in mind that
the test execution may not finish until the stream duration has elapsed.

By using the Jio `Debugger` extension, you can gain valuable insights into the behavior of the components in your tests,
helping you identify and resolve issues more effectively.

### <a name="stubs"><a/> Stubs

### <a name="iostubs"><a/> Creating IO Stubs

In the realm of testing, it's often necessary to construct stubs that simulate specific behaviors or responses within
your code. To address this need, the `StubBuilder` and `Gens` classes offer practical solutions for crafting `IO`
instances with tailored behaviors designed for testing scenarios. The `StubBuilder` class empowers you to produce stubs
for generating `IO` instances through generators. These stubs offer extensive customization and are instrumental for
simulating a wide range of behaviors, spanning from successful executions to failures and controlled delays. The `Gens`
class complements this by providing a diverse set of generator methods, each adept at generating IO instances with
unique behaviors.

You can create a `StubBuilder` using various methods, depending on your testing needs:

- **`ofIOGen`:** Create a stub using a generator of `IO` effects. IO generators can produce exceptions as normal values,
  which is useful for testing how your code reacts to errors.

  ```code
  // The first call produces a failure
  Gen<IO<Integer>> gen = Gens.seq(n -> n == 1 ? IO.fail(new RuntimeException()) : IO.succeed(n));
  
  StubBuilder<Integer> stub = StubBuilder.ofIOGen(gen);
  ```

- **`ofGen`:** Create a stub using a generator of values (never fail). Remember that generators are created with the
  library [java-fun](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/java-fun).

You can also configure your stub as follows:

- **`withExecutor`:** Set an executor to generate values using threads from this executor. This can be useful for
  controlling the concurrency of value generation.

```code

stub.withExecutor(yourExecutor);

```

- **`withDelays`:** Specify delays for the stub using a generator of `Duration`. This can be useful for testing retry
  policies where retries are executed after waiting for some time.

  ```code
  // The first call results in an error
  Gen<IO<Integer>> gen = Gens.seq(n -> n == 1 ? IO.fail(new RuntimeException()) : IO.succeed(n));
  
  // The first call has a 1-second delay
  Gen<Duration> delayGen = Gen.seq(n -> n == 1 ? Duration.ofSeconds(1) : Duration.ZERO);

  stub.withDelays(delayGen);
  ```

With these tools, you can easily create stubs and generators for testing your code with various scenarios, behaviors,
and timing conditions. This flexibility makes it easier to ensure the robustness of your code in different situations.

Happy testing!

#### <a name="clockstubs"><a/> Clock stubs

The `ClockStub` class provides a simple way to create clock stubs for controlling time-related behavior in your
applications during testing and development. Clock stubs allow you to simulate various time scenarios, making it easier
to test time-dependent functionalities in your code.

##### Overview

In testing and development scenarios, controlling time can be crucial when working with applications that have
time-sensitive functionality. The `ClockStub` class is designed to create clock stubs that mimic the behavior of
actual clocks. These clock stubs give you the ability to manipulate time-related behavior to ensure your application
behaves as expected under various time conditions.

##### Creating a Clock Stub

You can create a clock stub using one of the following methods:

###### From a Reference Time

The `fromReference` static factory method allows you to create a clock stub that starts ticking from the provided
reference time. This method is useful when you want the clock to behave as if it started at a specific instant.

```code
Instant reference = Instant.parse("2023-01-15T12:00:00.00Z");

Clock clock = ClockStub.fromReference(reference);

```

##### Using a Function

The `fromSeqCalls` static factory method enables you to create a clock stub where you can control the ticking time based
on
the number of calls made to the clock. This method provides dynamic time simulation, allowing you to simulate time
progression based on your specific requirements.

```code
// Simulate time progressing by 1 hour with each call
Function<Integer, Long> timeFunction = n -> Instant.now()
                                                   .plus(Duration.ofHours(n))
                                                   .toEpochMilli();

Clock clock = ClockStub.fromCalls(timeFunction);

```

#### Http Server Stubs

jio-http provides dedicated stubs for various HTTP methods, allowing you to define the `HttpHandler` of an HTTP server
with precision. Here's a list of available HTTP method stubs:

- DeleteStub: Simulates the DELETE HTTP method.
- GetStub: Simulates the GET HTTP method.
- OptionsStub: Simulates the OPTIONS HTTP method.
- PatchStub: Simulates the PATCH HTTP method.
- PostStub: Simulates the POST HTTP method.
- PutStub: Simulates the PUT HTTP method.

Each of these HTTP method stubs is constructed from three core functions: `BodyStub`, `StatusCodeStub`,
and `HeadersStub`. These functions
each accept four input parameters with the following signature:

```code

IntFunction<Function<InputStream, Function<URI, Function<Headers, R>>>

```

Here's what each parameter represents:

1. The first integer parameter is the request number received by the server. In Jio-HTTP, the server maintains an
   internal counter that increments with each incoming request.

2. The `InputStream` parameter stands for the input of the request body.

3. The `URI` parameter represents the request's URI, including all query and path parameters.

4. The `Headers` parameter captures the request headers.

The type `R` can be a string in the case of `BodyStub`, an integer for `StatusCodeStub`, and headers for `HeadersStub`.

There are some predefined `BodyStub` options:

```code
interface BodyStub {
   
   static BodyStub gen(Gen<String> gen);
   
   static BodyStub cons(String body);
   
   static BodyStub consAfter(String body, Duration delay);
}
```

You can create your own `BodyStub` by implementing a function like this:

```code 
BodyStub myStub = reqCounter -> bodyStream -> uri -> reqHeaders -> {
    String responseBody = ???;
    // Your custom stub implementation here
    return responseBody;
}
```

Predefined `StatusCodeStub` options include:

```code 
interface StatusCodeStub {
  
  static StatusCodeStub cons(int code);
}
```

Just like `BodyStub`, you can craft your own `StatusCodeStub` by creating a function like this:

```code 
StatusCodeStub myStub = reqCounter -> bodyStream -> uri -> reqHeaders -> {
    int statusCodeResponse = ???;
    // Your custom stub implementation here
    return statusCodeResponse;
}
```

For `HeadersStub`, there are some predefined options:

```code
interface HeadersStub {

    HeadersStub EMPTY;
    
    static HeadersStub cons(Map<String, List<String>> map);
}
```

You can also define a custom `HeadersStub` function. For instance, here's one that returns the exact headers of the
request:

```code 
HeadersStub bounceHeaders = reqCounter -> bodyStream -> uri -> reqHeaders -> reqHeaders;
```

Now, let's put it all together with a complete example:

```code
HttpHandler saludate = GetStub.of(BodyStub.consAfter("hi", Duration.ofSeconds(1)),
                                  StatusCodeStub.cons(200),
                                  HeadersStub.EMPTY
                                  );

JsObjGen personGen = ???;                           

HttpHandler create = PostStub.of(BodyStub.gen(personGen),
                                  StatusCodeStub.gen(Combinators.oneOf(200, 201)),
                                  HeadersStub.EMPTY
                                  );                            

HttpServer server = HttpServerBuilder.of(Map.of("/saludate", saludate))
                                     .startAtRandom("localhost", 8000, 9000);
```

Creating servers and adding stubs for testing purposes with jio-http is remarkably straightforward. Here's why:

1. **Abundance of Stub Types**: Jio-HTTP offers a variety of pre-defined stubs, such
   as `DeleteStub`, `GetStub`, `OptionsStub`, and more. You can choose the stub that fits your testing scenario.

2. **Customizable Behavior**: With `BodyStub`, `StatusCodeStub`, and `HeadersStub`, you have fine-grained control over
   your stubs. These stubs allow you to tailor the responses, status codes, and headers, as needed.

3. **Simple Stub Creation**: You can create your own custom stubs with just a simple function implementation. This makes
   it easy to simulate specific behaviors or responses that your test cases require.

4. **Ease of Testing**: The ability to add these stubs to your `HttpServer` facilitates efficient and reliable testing.
   You can simulate various scenarios, including successes, failures, and delays.

5. **Integration with Generators**: The stubs can be integrated with generators to further diversify your test cases.
   For instance, you can use `JsObjGen` to generate complex JSON objects for testing.

In summary, jio-http simplifies the process of creating HTTP servers and adding stubs for testing purposes. Its
user-friendly design and flexibility make it a valuable tool for ensuring the robustness and reliability of your
HTTP-based applications.

### <a name="pbt"><a/> Property based testing

#### Quick Example: Using Property-Based Testing to Find Hard-to-Reproduce Bugs

Consider a seemingly straightforward function, medium, designed to calculate the average of two integers.

```code 

BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> medium = (a, b) -> (a + b) / 2;

```

At first glance, you might think it's bug-free – after all, it's just a sum and a division. However, in the world of
software development, assumptions like this can be misleading. Bugs can lurk even in the simplest-looking code.

Let's start by creating a generator to produce inputs, which are pairs of integers (`a` and `b`) with the constraint
that `a` is less than `b`. We can achieve this using the "java-fun" library:

```code
Gen<Pair<Integer, Integer>> gen = 
    PairGen.of(IntGen.biased(0),
               IntGen.biased(0))
          .suchThat(pair -> pair.first() < pair.second());
```

Next, we need to define a meaningful property that the `medium` function must satisfy. For example, we can ensure that
the `medium` value always stays within the bounds defined by `a` and `b`:

```code
Function<Pair<Integer, Integer>, TestResult> prop = 
    pair -> {
        var a = pair.first();
        var b = pair.second();
        var mean = medium.apply(a, b);
        if (mean < a) return TestFailure.reason("mean lower than a");
        if (mean > b) return TestFailure.reason("mean greater than b");
        return TestResult.SUCCESS;
    };
```

Finally, we can create the `Property` using the `PropBuilder`:

```code  
public class TestProperties {

    static BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> medium = (a, b) -> (a + b) / 2;
    
    static Property<Pair<Integer, Integer>> mediumProperty =
            PropBuilder.of("medium",
                           gen,
                           prop
                           )
                       .withDescription("medium must fall between bounds")
                       .build();
               
    @Test
    public void testMedium() {
        Resport report = mediumProperty.check();
        report.assertAllSuccess();

    }
}
```

Upon executing the test, a summary of the `Report` is displayed in the console, providing essential information about
the test run. Here's what you'll see:

```text
Property medium executed 1000 times at 2023-10-15T20:23:52.879607+02:00 for 7,434 ms:
  ! KO, passed 661 tests (66.1%) and 339 tests (33.9%) ended with a failure.
  Some generated values that caused a failure:
   (2147483647, 2147483647), (1533547426, 2147483647), (1430393771, 1952366707), (361315880, 2147483647), (1810849822, 2147483647), (127, 2147483647), (1571969759, 1917332428), (32767, 2147483647), (571967758, 2131558478), (1725653506, 2147483647), (650519903, 1591944271), (720273507, 1909947616), (2147483647, 2147483647), (127, 2147483647), (32767, 2147483647), (1878197279, 2147483647), (1074371667, 1961393980), (1560183752, 2147483647), (1104900558, 1836571965), (771721558, 2147483647)
```

Additionally, JUnit provides a more detailed report. If there are any issues or failures during testing, a message from
JUnit containing the full report is printed. This comprehensive report is invaluable for identifying and addressing any
problems in your code.

```text

You might not anticipate a failure in such a straightforward function, but don't be too concerned. It's worth noting
that this issue has persisted for a considerable period in various programming languages, even affecting binary search
algorithms. For more insights into this matter, I recommend reading the detailed account provided by Joshua Bloch in his
informative
post: [Google Research Blog](https://blog.research.google/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).

It's important to mention that, as of now, jio-test doesn't include a feature called "shrinking," which is a technique
used to minimize the failing example to its simplest form. However, the framework does offer methods to help you
identify the reasons behind test failures. One useful practice is to classify the generated data. In the example you've
shared, it's evident that larger numbers, specifically 2147483647 (which corresponds to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`), are
causing failures more frequently. This is because biased integer generators tend to produce this value with a higher
probability.

To address this, you can classify the generated data by adding tags to the pairs `(a,b)` based on their characteristics:

- "both" for pairs where both values are greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2`.
- "none" for pairs where neither value exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2`.
- "one" for pairs where only one element of the pair surpasses `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2."

This classification allows you to gain better insights into the nature of test failures and helps you focus on specific
scenarios where problems are more likely to occur. This can be incredibly powerful for spotting and addressing bugs that
might be extremely challenging to reproduce otherwise.

```
static Property<Pair<Integer, Integer>> mediumProperty =
            PropBuilder.of("medium",
                           gen,
                           prop
                           )
                       .withClassifiers(Map.of("both",
                                                p -> p.first() > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2
                                                    && p.second() > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2,
                                               "none",
                                                p -> p.first() < Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2
                                                    && p.second() < Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2
                                                ),
                                         "one"
                                        )
                       .withDescription("medium must fall between bounds")
                       .build();


```

Now, if we examine the output, you'll notice the following:

```text
Property medium executed 1000 times at 2023-10-15T20:28:11.580574+02:00 for 19,361 ms:
  ! KO, passed 674 tests (67,4 %) and 326 (32,6 %) ended with a failure.
  Some generated values that caused a failure:
   ((32767, 2147483647), one),((2147483647, 2147483647), both),((127, 2147483647), one),((32767, 2147483647), one),((1367738157, 2147483647), both),((32767, 2147483647), one),((2147483647, 2147483647), both),((1365877821, 1519800076), both),((929386296, 2147483647), one),((1663592320, 2147483647), both),((687170227, 2147483647), one),((127, 2147483647), one),((127, 2147483647), one),((32767, 2147483647), one),((686789583, 1494899307), one),((261853601, 2066273042), one),((23902795, 2147483647), one),((2147483647, 2147483647), both),((1746060008, 2147483647), both),((32767, 2147483647), one)
  1000 values collected in total:
     44,4 % one
     40,7 % none
     14,9 % both
```

From this output, you can see that there were no test failures when the "none" tag was applied to the generated values.
However, when at least one element, either `a` or `b`, is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2`, it may result in an
overflow. If you read Joshua Bloch's article, you'll recognize that the correct way to calculate the medium is as
follows:

By changing the implementation of the `medium` property, you can avoid the error:

```code

static BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> medium = (a,b) -> a+(b-a)/2;

// Alternatively
static BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> medium = (a,b) -> (a+b)>>>1;
```

With this corrected implementation, there are no test failures:

```text
Property medium executed 1000 times at 2023-10-15T20:34:15.031869+02:00 for 15,734 ms:
  + OK, passed 1000 tests.
  1000 values collected in total:
     45.8 % one
     39.7 % none
     14.5 % both
```

This change ensures that the average of two integers is calculated correctly, and all tests pass without any failures.

#### Introduction

In the realm of property-based testing, a "property" is a fundamental concept representing a condition or invariant that
a piece of code or a program should always satisfy, without failing under any circumstances. These properties serve as
essential checks to ensure the correctness and reliability of software.

A "Property" is represented in jio-test by a class called `Property`. This class encapsulates a specific property that
you want to test. The primary components of a `Property` include:

- **Name:** A descriptive label that identifies the property being tested.
- **Data Generator (`Gen<O>`):** A generator that produces pseudorandom data of type `O`. This data is used to feed the
  property tests.
- **Testing Function or Lambda:** A function or lambda that tests the property, taking the generated data as
  input and producing a `TestResult`, which indicates whether the property holds or fails.

Let's look at the key elements that constitute a `Property`:

##### Name

The name provides a descriptive label for the property being tested. It should succinctly describe the behavior or
condition that the property is checking.

##### Data Generator

The data generator, represented by a `java.fun.Gen<O>` object, is responsible for creating pseudorandom data. This data
serves as input for property testing. The quality and diversity of the generated data play a crucial role in the
effectiveness of property-based testing. In jio-test, I utilize the data generators provided by the `java-fun` library.
These generators can create a wide range of data types, from simple values like integers and strings to more complex
data structures.

##### Biased Generators for Exploratory Testing

For exploratory purposes, it's often recommended to use biased generators. Biased generators assign higher probabilities
to values that are known to produce more bugs or exceptional cases. For example, consider values like zero, empty
strings, blank strings, `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, and more. Biased generators can help you uncover hidden issues in your code
by focusing on these critical cases during testing.

##### Testing Function

The testing function is a critical part of the `Property`. It is the code or logic that evaluates whether the property
holds true for the generated data. There are two primary ways to define the testing function:

1. **Function (`Function<O, TestResult>`):** This form of the testing function takes the generated data (`O`) and
   returns a `TestResult`. The `TestResult` indicates the success or failure of the property test.

2. **Lambda (`Lambda<O, TestResult>`):** Certain properties may be defined using Lambdas instead of functions,
   especially when they involve IO operations where exceptions can occur. In such cases, these exceptions do not halt
   the property's execution but are considered and reported in the final test report.

#### Creating a Property

Creating a property involves creating a `PropBuilder` instance to build the property you want to test:

- `PropBuilder.of(String name, Gen<O> gen, Function<O, TestResult> property)`: Use this method when your testing
  function
  takes generated data (`O`) as input. This form of the testing function is useful when no additional configuration is
  needed
  for the property test.

- `PropBuilder.ofLambda(String name, Gen<O> gen, Lambda<O, TestResult> property)`: When your testing function is a
  lambda that only
  requires generated data (`O`), this method is the appropriate choice.

With the builder instance you can further customize the property by specifying the number of test executions,
providing a description, setting classifiers, and more.

#### Using Classifiers for Categorization

Exploratory testing can benefit from classifying generated data into different categories. Classifiers are created using
the `withClassifiers(Map<String, Predicate<O>> classifiers, String defaultTag)` method of the builder. These classifiers
can help you group data into various categories based on specific criteria and identify tags assigned to values that
produce errors.

#### Collecting Data for Analysis

To gather data for debugging and analysis, you can enable data collection using the `withCollector()` method of the
builder. This feature allows you to collect data about the generated values, helping you identify patterns or trends in
the generated data.

#### Analyzing Results

After executing a property, you obtain a `Report` containing detailed information about the test execution.
The `Report` class has the following fields and their meanings (which can be serialized into a JSON format):

- `name`: The name of the property.
- `n_tests`: The number of executed tests.
- `n_failures`: The number of test failures.
- `n_exceptions`: The number of exceptions raised during testing.
- `description`: The description of the property.
- `start_time`: The start time of test execution.
- `end_time`: The end time of test execution.
- `avg_time`: The average execution time in milliseconds.
- `max_time`: The maximum execution time in milliseconds.
- `min_time`: The minimum execution time in milliseconds.
- `accumulative_time`: The accumulative execution time in milliseconds.
- `failures`: An array of failure contexts, each containing a reason and context.
- `exceptions`: An array of exception contexts, each containing a message, type, and stack trace.

Exceptions or failures has an associated context (`Context` class) with the following fields:

- `start`: Represents the instant when a test starts. This timestamp is essential for tracking the timing of test
  execution.
- `seed`: Signifies the seed for random data generation. This seed is crucial for reproducing bugs since pseudo-random
  generators always produce the same sequence of values when fed with the same seed. It ensures the ability to recreate
  the exact data sequence.
- `generatedSeqNumber`: Denotes the sequence number for data generation. This number helps in understanding the order
  of data generation and identifying patterns or issues in the data.
- `input`: Represents the input data of the test. This field provides insight into the specific data that was used
  during a test execution. It's important for analyzing the test's behavior and identifying problematic inputs.
- `tags`: Contains a string that can be used to categorize the input data, based on classifiers or conditions. This
  information helps in identifying and categorizing specific inputs and associating them with potential issues.

These fields collectively provide valuable context information for each test execution. In particular, the `seed`
and `generatedSeqNumber` fields are vital for reproducing bugs because they allow you to precisely recreate the sequence
of random data that led to a specific issue.

By examining the `Report` class, you can gain valuable insights into the performance of your property-based tests,
identify failures, and pinpoint exceptions.

The `Report` class defines several methods that are used for assertions in JUnit tests. Here's a breakdown of these
methods and how they are used for assertions:

1. `assertAllSuccess()`: This method is used to assert that all tests associated with the report have passed
   successfully. If there are any failures or exceptions, this assertion will fail. It checks if both `getExceptions()`
   and `getFailures()` lists are empty. If they are not empty, it raises an assertion failure with a message indicating
   the presence of failures and exceptions.

2. `assertNoFailures()`: This method is used to assert that there are no failures associated with the report. If there
   are any failures, this assertion will fail. It checks if the `getFailures()` list is empty. If it's not empty, it
   raises an assertion failure with a message indicating the presence of failures.

3. `assertThat(Predicate<Report> condition, Supplier<String> message)`: This is a custom assertion method that allows
   for a user-defined condition to be evaluated against the report. The `condition` parameter is a predicate that is
   applied to the report, and the `message` parameter is a supplier that provides a message to be used if the condition
   fails. If the condition is not satisfied, an assertion failure is raised with the message supplied by the `message`
   supplier.

These methods are used in unit tests to verify the correctness of property-based tests and to check if the reported
results match the expected outcomes. They help ensure that the properties defined in property-based tests hold true and
that the tests are executed without failures or exceptions.

#### Exporting Reports

The results of property testing can be exported to a file using the `withExportPath(Path path)` method. This file
contains a JSON representation of the test report, which is useful for sharing and archiving test results.

The `Property` class is part of a property-based testing framework in Java. It represents a property of a piece of code
that should always be true. The class allows you to define, customize, execute, and report on property tests.

Here, I'll explain two methods within the `Property` class: `repeatSeq` and `repeatPar`.

#### `repeatSeq(int n)`

This method returns a new `Property` instance that represents the property and specifies that it should be executed
sequentially for the specified number of times (`n`).

- `n` (int): The number of sequential executions for the property.

Use Case:

- This method is useful when you want to run the property test multiple times in a sequential manner, one after the
  other. It's suitable for situations where you don't require parallel execution and want to ensure the property holds
  true consistently.

#### `repeatPar(int n)`

This method returns a new `Property` instance that represents the property and specifies that it should be executed in
parallel for the specified number of times (`n`). Parallel execution involves running the property tests concurrently
using multiple threads from the common ForkJoinPool.

- `n` (int): The number of parallel executions for the property.

Use Case:

- When you want to take advantage of parallelism to speed up the property-based testing process, you can use this
  method. It's beneficial for running multiple property tests concurrently, which can be more time-efficient.
- Provides the ability to conduct property tests in parallel, executing them a specified number of times. Parallel
  property testing can be a valuable tool for detecting bugs related to concurrency, as it runs multiple tests
  concurrently using multiple threads. This can help uncover issues that might not be apparent in sequential testing,
  making it particularly useful for identifying and addressing concurrency-related defects in your code.

In both cases, the original `Property` instance is not modified, and a new instance is returned with the specified
execution mode.

These methods allow you to customize how property tests are executed, whether sequentially or in parallel, depending on
your testing requirements and constraints. They provide flexibility in adapting the testing strategy to the specific
needs of your codebase or project.

set of codecs defined in [mongo-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/mongo-values), making it an efficient solution
for MongoDB operations.

jio-mongodb is composed of a set of MongoLambdas to perform operations against the database. With Lambdas, you can
benefit
from all the powerful features of `jio-exp` and `jio-test`. `jio-mongodb` is an example of how you can make any API
under the sun jio-friendly, unleashing the full potential of your code.

### MongoLambda

Sure, here's a readme section for the `MongoLambda` interface from your class:

---

## MongoDB Lambdas

The `MongoLambda` interface in Jio provides a versatile way to define MongoDB operations that produce IO effects within
a MongoDB client session. These lambdas can be used with or without transactions, offering flexibility in working with
MongoDB databases.

### Interface Overview

#### Definition

The `MongoLambda<I, O>` interface represents a function that takes an input of type `I` and produces an IO effect of
type `O` within a MongoDB client session.

```code

interface MongoLambda<I, O> extends BiLambda<ClientSession, I, O> {

      Lambda<I, O> standalone();
      <B> MongoLambda<I, B> then(MongoLambda<O, B> other) { }
      <B> MongoLambda<I, B> then(Lambda<O, B> other) {}
      <C> MongoLambda<I, C> map(Function<O, C> fn) {}
}

```

Key points:

- Using transactions with MongoDB is optional. You can create a `MongoLambda` that produces effects independently of any
  transaction by calling the `standalone()` method. This is useful when you want to perform operations that don't
  require transactional behavior.

- One powerful feature of `MongoLambda` is the ability to chain operations together. You can chain this interface with
  another `MongoLambda` to create a new `MongoLambda`. The result is a sequence of operations executed within the same
  MongoDB client session, with the output of one operation becoming the input to the next one.

- You can also chain a `MongoLambda` with a non-transactional `Lambda` to create a new `MongoLambda`. This allows you to
  mix transactional and non-transactional operations while maintaining session continuity.

- The `MongoLambda` interface lets you map the output of an operation using a provided function. You can create a
  new `MongoLambda` where the mapping function is applied to the output of the original operation.

This allows you to create flexible and expressive MongoDB operations with transactional or non-transactional behavior as
required.

In the upcoming sections, we'll explore a variety of pre-defined `MongoLambda` functions that are available in
the `jio-mongodb`.

### Creating a Collection Builder<a name="creating-a-collection-supplier"></a>

To get started, you need a `MongoClient`, a `DatabaseBuilder`, and finally a `CollectionBuilder` that provides access
to a MongoDB collection. Below is an example of how to create both:

```code
String connectionStr = "mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/?replicaSet=rs0"

MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClientBuilder.DEFAULT.build(connectionStr);

String databaseName = "test";

DatabaseBuilder database =  DatabaseBuilder.of(mongoClient,databaseName);

String collectionName = "Data";

CollectionBuilder collection = CollectionBuilder.of(database,collectionName);
```

The `MongoClientBuilder` class is for creating MongoDB client instances with custom configurations. This class provides
flexibility in building MongoDB client instances and allows you to specify your own connection string and settings
functions. The default instance, `DEFAULT` is a pre-configured builder with the default settings and codecs from
[mongo-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/mongo-values) to work with JSON data from the
[json-values](https://github.com/imrafaelmerino/json-values) library.

Now that you have a `CollectionBuilder`, you can perform various operations on it.

## Find Operations<a name="find-operations"></a>

The key class for creating queries and specifying options for find operations is `FindBuilder`. Here's how to perform
find operations:

### FindOne

```code
CollectionBuilder collection = ???;
JsObj query = ???;

Lambda<FindBuilder, JsObj> find = FindOne.of(collection).standalone();

FindBuilder builder = FindBuilder.of(query);

IO<JsObj> io = find.apply(builder);

```

### FindAll

```code

CollectionBuilder collection = ???;
JsObj query = ???;

Lambda<FindBuilder, FindIterable<JsObj>>find = FindAll.of(collection).standalone();

FindBuilder builder = FindBuilder.of(query);

IO<FindIterable<JsObj>> xs = find.apply(builder);

//map the output with predefined converters
IO<List<JsObj>> ioList = xs.map(Converters::toListOfJsObj);

IO<JsArray> ioArray = xs.map(Converters::toJsArray);
```

## Insert Operations<a name="insert-operations"></a>

### InsertOne

```code

JsObj doc = ???;

Lambda<JsObj, InsertOneResult> insert = InsertOne.of(collection).standalone();

IO<String> x = insert.apply(doc).map(Converters::toHexId);

```

### InsertMany

```code
List<JsObj> docs = ???;

Lambda<List<JsObj>, InsertManyResult> insert = InsertMany.of(collection).standalone();

IO<List<String>> xs = insert.apply(docs).map(Converters::toListOfHexIds);

```

## Delete Operations<a name="delete-operations"></a>

### DeleteOne

```code

JsObj query = ???;

Lambda<JsObj, DeleteResult> deleteOne = DeleteOne.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = deleteOne.apply(query).map(Converters::toJsObj);

```

### DeleteMany

```code

JsObj query = ???;

Lambda<JsObj, DeleteResult> deleteMany = DeleteMany.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = deleteMany.apply(query).map(Converters::toJsObj);

```

## Update and Replace Operations<a name="update-and-replace-operations"></a>

### UpdateOne

```code

JsObj query = ???;
JsObj update = ???;

Lambda<QueryUpdate, UpdateResult> updateOne = UpdateOne.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = updateOne.apply(new QueryUpdate(query,update)).map(Converters::toJsObj);

```

### UpdateMany

```code

JsObj query = ???;
JsObj update = ???;

Lambda<QueryUpdate, UpdateResult> updateOne = UpdateMany.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = updateOne.apply(new QueryUpdate(query,update)).map(Converters::toJsObj);

```

### ReplaceOne

```code

JsObj query = ???;
JsObj newDoc = ???;

Lambda<QueryReplace, UpdateResult> replaceOne = ReplaceOne.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = replaceOne.apply(new QueryReplace(query,newDoc)).map(Converters::toJsObj);

```

## Count<a name="count"></a>

```code
JsObj query = ???;

Lambda<JsObj, Long> count = Count.of(collection).standalone();

IO<Long> io = count.apply(query);
```

## FindOneAndXXX Operations<a name="findoneandxxx-operations"></a>

### FindOneAndUpdate

```code
JsObj query = ???;

JsObj update = ???;

Lambda<QueryUpdate, JsObj> findOneUpdate = FindOneAndUpdate.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = findOneUpdate.apply(new QueryUpdate(query,update));
```

### FindOneAndReplace

```code
JsObj query = ???;

JsObj newDoc = ???;

Lambda<QueryReplace, JsObj> findOneReplace = FindOneAndReplace.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = findOneReplace.apply(new QueryReplace(query,newDoc));
```

### FindOneAndDelete

```code
JsObj query = ???;

Lambda<JsObj, JsObj> findOneDelete = FindOneAndDelete.of(collection).standalone();

IO<JsObj> x = findOneDelete.apply(query);
```

## Aggregate<a name="aggregate"></a>

```code

List<Bson> stages = ???;

Lambda<List<Bson>, AggregateIterable<JsObj>> aggregate = Aggregate.of(collection).standalone();

IO<List<JsObj>> x = aggregate.apply(stages).map(Converters::toListOfJsObj);

//or using JsObj as an input instead of Bson

Lambda<List<JsObj>, List<JsObj>> y = 
    list -> {
                List<Bson> bsons = list.stream().map(Converters::toBson).toList();
                return aggregate.apply(bsons).map(Converters::toListOfJsObj);
    };

```

## Watcher<a name="watcher"></a>

You can set up a change stream on a MongoDB collection to monitor changes using the `Watcher` class:

```code

CollectionBuilder builder = CollectionBuilder.of(database,collectionName);

Consumer<ChangeStreamIterable<JsObj>> consumer = iter -> { ??? };

Watcher.of(consumer).accept(builder);
```

## Common Exceptions<a name="common-exceptions"></a>

The `MongoExceptions` utility class provides predicates to handle common exceptions:

1. `READ_TIMEOUT`:
    - **Description**: This predicate checks if the given Throwable is an instance of `MongoSocketReadTimeoutException`.
      It returns true if the exception is a read timeout exception and false otherwise. Read timeout exceptions
      typically occur when a read operation (e.g., reading data from the database) takes longer than the specified
      timeout.

2. `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`:
    - **Description**: This predicate checks if the given Throwable is an instance of `MongoTimeoutException`. It
      returns true if the exception is a connection timeout exception and false otherwise. Connection timeout exceptions
      usually happen when there's a timeout while attempting to establish a connection to the MongoDB server.

Here's an example of how to use these predicates for resilient applications:

```code
JsObj query = ???;

var builder = FindBuilder.of(query);

IO<JsObj> io = FindOne.of(collection)
                      .apply(builder)
                      .retry(MongoExceptions.CONNECTION_TIMEOUT,
                             RetryPolicies.limitRetries(3)
                             );
```

## JFR Integration<a name="jfr-integration"></a>

By default, all operations create an event when finished and send it to the Java Flight Recorder (JFR) system. You can
disable this behavior using the `withoutRecordedEvents` method.

Register the Junit Debugger extension from `jio-test` in your tests:

```code

@RegisterExtension
static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

```

This extension enables you to see printed-out events like the following:

```plaintext

event: mongodb, op: INSERT_ONE, duration: 37,800 ms, result: SUCCESS
thread: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-23, event-start-time: 2023-10-17T19:10:30.86140575+02:00

event: mongodb, op: INSERT_ONE, duration: 37,416 ms, result: SUCCESS
thread: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-27, event-start-time: 2023-10-17T19:10:30.861923625+02:00

event: mongodb, op: FIND, duration: 1,362 ms, result: SUCCESS
thread: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-18, event-start-time: 2023-10-17T19:10:30.899902583+02:00

```

## Specifying an Executor<a name="specifying-an-executor"></a>

Every operation (FindOne, InsertOne, DeleteOne, etc.) type has a method `on(Executor executor)` to specify the executor
from which thread will be used to evaluate the Lambdas. You can use virtual threads if you are running `jio-mongodb` in
Java 21:

```code

Lambda<FindBuilder, JsObj> find =  FindOne.of(collection)
                                          .withExecutor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())
                                          .standalone();

```

If no executor is specified, one from the Fork Join Pool will be used since `jio-mongodb` uses
the `IO.managedLazy(supplier)` method from `jio-exp`.

This revised README provides a comprehensive guide to using the `jio-mongodb` package, offering detailed examples and
explanations for each operation. Developers can now use this documentation as a reference when working with MongoDB in
their Java applications.

Certainly! When working with the `jio-mongodb` package, you have the flexibility to pass your custom converters and
configure various options to customize the behavior of MongoDB operations. Here's a brief explanation of how to pass
other converters and options:

## Configuring Options

You can also configure various options for MongoDB operations using the `withOptions` method available for some
operations. Options allow you to specify things like the write concern, bypass document validation, and more.

For instance, if you want to configure custom `UpdateOptions` for an `UpdateOne` operation:

```code

UpdateOptions customOptions = new UpdateOptions().upsert(true)  // Example option

Lambda<QueryUpdate, UpdateResult> updateOne = 
    UpdateOne.of(collection)
             .withOptions(customOptions)
             .standalone();

```

By passing custom options, you can fine-tune the behavior of your MongoDB operations to match your specific use case.

## Transactions with jio-mongodb

Up to this point, we have been using the standalone method provided by MongoLambdas for operations that do not require
transactions. Now, let's explore how to create and work with transactions in jio-mongodb.

jio-mongodb provides a convenient way to work with MongoDB transactions. Transactions in MongoDB allow you to perform
multiple operations within a single session, ensuring that either all the operations are executed or none of them,
providing a consistent view of your data.

### TxBuilder

The `TxBuilder` class is used to create transactions in a MongoDB client session. It offers options to configure
transaction settings and create transaction instances.

#### Methods:

- `of(ClientSessionBuilder sessionBuilder)`: Creates a new `TxBuilder` instance with the provided session builder.
- `withTxOptions(TransactionOptions transactionOptions)`: Sets the transaction options for the transactions created with
  this builder.
- `build(MongoLambda<I, O> mongoLambda)`: Builds a transaction with the specified MongoDB Lambda function and
  transaction options.

### Tx

The `Tx` class represents a MongoDB transaction that can be applied within a MongoDB client session. This class ensures
that the transaction is executed consistently and provides methods for defining and applying the transaction.

#### Methods:

- `apply(I i)`: Applies the MongoDB transaction to the given input, executing it within a MongoDB client session.

**Note:** MongoDB sessions are not multi-threaded. Only one thread should operate within a MongoDB session at a time to
avoid errors like "Only servers in a sharded cluster can start a new transaction at the active transaction number."

### Example: Inserting JSON Documents in a Transaction

The following example demonstrates how to use jio-mongodb to insert a list of JSON documents within a MongoDB
transaction:

```code  


public class TestTx {

    @RegisterExtension
    static Debugger debugger = Debugger.of(Duration.ofSeconds(2));

    String connection = "mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/?replicaSet=rs0";
    
    MongoClient mongoClient = 
         MongoClientBuilder.DEFAULT
                           .build(connection);
    
    ClientSessionBuilder session = ClientSessionBuilder.of(mongoClient);
    
    DatabaseBuilder testDb = DatabaseBuilder.of(mongoClient, "test");
    
    CollectionBuilder personCol = CollectionBuilder.of(testDb, "Person");
    
    
    
    @Test
    public void test() {
        MongoLambda<JsObj, String> insertOne = InsertOne.of(personCol)
                                                        .map(Converters::toHexId);
        
        MongoLambda<List<JsObj>, List<String>> insertAll =
                (session, jsons) ->
                        jsons.stream()
                             .map(json -> insertOne.apply(session, json))
                             .collect(ListExp.seqCollector());

        Tx tx = TxBuilder.of(session).build(insertAll);

        List<String> ids = tx.apply(List.of(JsObj.of("a", JsInt.of(0)),
                                            JsObj.of("b", JsInt.of(1))
                                           )
                                    )
                             .result();
        
        Assertions.assertEquals(2, ids.size());                     
    }

}
```

It's worth highlighting the advantages of using the `jio-exp` API to create a `MongoLambda`. In the previous example, we
used a `ListExp.seq` to insert all the JSON documents sequentially. As mentioned earlier, using
the `ListExp.parCollector()` to insert all the JSON documents in parallel is not feasible due to MongoDB sessions not
being multi-threaded.

On the other hand, when using `TxBuilder` and `Tx`, you don't have to worry about the intricacies of committing or
rolling back the transaction in the event of an error, or explicitly closing the session. All of these essential
operations are automatically handled for you, making your code more robust and convenient.
